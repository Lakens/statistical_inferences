Comments and questions:

Ch.1 :

"(\sigma)"
--> The in-text sigma symbol is not rendered (at least in the html version). Instead a pair of empty brackets are shown.

- Reference missing for G*power software.

"Figure 1.9: Distribution of observed Cohen’s d effect sizes when collecting 50 observations per group in an independent t-test when d = 0."
--> This caption only appears to describe half of the plot.

"Note that the same is true for effects smaller than -0.4, even though there is no second label there, but the app shows the situation for a two-sided independent t-test."
--> I would suggest adding a screenshot of the shiny app after this paragraph as it is not so easy to read this section whilst constantly switching to another tab.

"It might be useful to think of the answer to the question whether an effect is absent after observing p > 0.05 as 無 (mu)"
--> Mu is printed as an Asian character.

"If we plot the null model for a very large sample size (e.g., n = 10000 per group) we see that even very small mean differences (those larger than 0.04) will be considered ‘surprising’. This still means that if there really is no difference in the population, you will observe differences larger than 0.04 less than 5% of the time, in the long run, and 95% of the observed differences will be smaller than a mean difference of 0.04."
--> How was the value of 0.04 calculated? According to the shiny app, with a sample size to 10000 and a true effect size of 0, the critical point is 0.03.

"It is mainly the verbal label ‘significant’ that causes confusion here – it is perhaps less confusing to think of a ‘significant’ effect as a ‘surprising’ effect, but not necessarily as an ‘important’ effect."
--> I suggest removing the word "verbal" or rephrasing along the lines of "It is mainly the use of the word 'significant"...".

"**Q4**: What would happen when there is no true difference between our simulated samples and the average IQ score?"
--> I was surprised to read that these values represented IQ scores. I don't think this was mentioned earlier.

"**Q8**: Play around with the sample size (n) and the mean (m) by changing the numerical values or both"
--> Did you mean: "by changing one or both of these values"?

"**Q2:** In what sense are the null models in @fig-fig131 and @fig-fig132 similar, and in what sense are they different?"
--> I find it rather misleading to refer to these two plots in the question given that neither of them show t-values.


"**Q5:** Why can’t you conclude that the null hypothesis is true, when you observe a statistically non-significant *p*-value (*p* \> alpha)?"
--> I was surprised to see that the "correct" answer is the one about possibly making a Type 2 error. This sounds to me like a Type 1 error.
