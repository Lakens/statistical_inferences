Sidman, 1960: It is recognized, at least implicitly,
that, despite p u b l i c protestations to the contrary, scientists are
usually intensely and personally i n v o l v e d w i t h their theories. Consequently,
t h e selection of data i n theory-testing experiments calls for
i n t e l l i g e n t skepticism. O n e must ask whether the selection was
made o n the basis of legitimate practices or, consciously or otherwise,
o n the basis of consistency w i t h a hypothesis.

Th e ideal solution
is t o encourage t h e p u b l i c a t i o n of r e l a t i v e l y long, integrated scries of
researches. B y the time an experimenter reaches t h e end of such a
program, he w i l l have had sufficient experience w i t h his subject
matter to permit judgments concerning the acceptance, and reject i o n of variable data. U n f o r t u n a t e l y , the modern stress u p o n frequency
of p u b l i c a t i o n , w i t h its economic rewards, mitigates strongly
against such a course of action.
