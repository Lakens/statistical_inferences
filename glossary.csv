Term,Definition
scientific research,"Resarch where 1) the goal is inference, 2) the procedures are public, and 3) the conclusions are uncertain"
inference,the process of making conclusions about some unobserved or unmeasured phenomenon based on our direct observations of the world
inductive reasoning,reasoning from specific observations to the generation of hypotheses and theories
deductive reasoning,reasoning that makes conclusions about some unobserved or unmeasured phenomenon based on direct observations of the world
mixed methods,designs that utilize both inductive and deductive reasoning
causal inference,determining whether or not there is a relationship where one variable causes another; seeks to establish that X causes Y
descriptive inference,goes beyond basic description (or collection of facts) to say something about how indiviudal experiences and opinions illuminate something more universal about the research problem at hand
empiricism,to use what observations to make conclusions about what cannot or will not be observed directly; at the heart of scientific research
empirical evidence,the systematic observations that are used in the process of empiricism
replication,refers to the ability of another research group to be able to follow the methods of a research study and replicate the results; relatively rare
reproducibility,the ability to generate a study's findings given the orginal dataset and sometimes the original analysis code
peer review,an important compnent of the scientific process where a scientist's peers evaluate a work before it is published in a journal
basic research,pursuit of fundamental knowledge of phenomena; forms the basis of clinical research
applied research,research focused on specific problems or applications
clinical research,"a broad field that encompasses patient-oriented research, epidemiological and behavioral studies, and outcomes research and health services research"
preclinical research,"The clinical research phase in which testing is performed in non-human subjects with the goal of collecting data on how well the medication works (efficacy), how much damage it can do to an organism (toxicity), and how it is affected by the body (pharmacokinetics)."
Phase I,"In clinical research, a trial that utilizes a small sample size in order to find a safe dosing range and look for side effects."
Phase II,"In clinical research, studies that demonstrate the efficacy of the medication against several endpoints (a.k.a. outcomes). Includes Phase IIa and Phase IIb."
Phase III,"In clinical research, typically a large trial to show that a treatment is efficacious."
Phase IV,"In clinical research, trials that evaluate a medication's long-term effects."
implementation science,Studies that assess to how to best get efficacious treatments to the people who need it most
translational research,"Studies that focus on getting interventions from ""bench to bedside"""
behavioral research,Research that focuses on the most effective ways to change people's behaviors in their daily life
program evaluation,
program monitoring,"Concerned with the implementation of programs, policies or interventions. Necessary for good evaluations."
theory failure,The failure of a program to be effective because the idea or theory behind the program was incorrect
implementation failure,The failure of a program to be effective because the program was not executed properly
research problem,A gap in the academic world's knowledge
stakeholders,Refers to a wide range of people and organizations that have some sort of vested interest in the outcome of a program's implementation
research question,
descriptive research,"Research that seeks to answer the question ""What is going on?"""
explanatory research,"Research that seeks to answer the question ""Why is it going on?"""
correlational research,A type of descriptive research that asks questions about the relationship (a.k.a association) between two or more variables; builds upon descriptive insights by attempting to predict or explain the behavior or phenomenon
quasi-experimental design,
experimental design,"a design where researchers manipulate some independent variable and examine changes to some dependent variable that result (considered the ""gold standard"" of designs)"
prevalence,"Prevalence is the number of existing cases out of the total population at a point in time. In contrast to incidence, which is a measure of disease occurrence, prevalence is a measure of existing disease. Prevalence is unit-less."
demographic research,"Research that seeks to understand more about population size, structure and change (e.g., birth, death migration, marriage, employment, education)"
representative,
needs assessments,
cross-sectional,
panel,
longitudinal,
sample,"In statistics, a sample refers to a set of observations drawn from a population."
correlational research,
dependent variable,"Also called the response variable or â€œy,â€ù the dependent variable is the â€œeffectâ€ù of the independent variable."
independent variable,"Also called the predictor variable or â€œx,â€ù the independent variable is the â€œcauseâ€ù of the dependent variable. In an experimental design, the independent variable is the variable that is manipulated by the experimenter."
point estimate,
confidence interval,"Statisticians use confidence intervals to express the degree of uncertainty associated with a sample statistic. For example, if we compute a 95% confidence interval for a sample mean, we can be 95% confident that the true population mean falls in-between the lower and upper bounds of that confidence interval. That is, if we used the same sampling method to select different samples and computed an interval estimate for each sample, we would expect the true population parameter to fall within the interval estimates 95% of the time. Confidence intervals are often preferred to p-values because they give additional information about the precision of the point estimate."

categorical data,
continuous data,
qualitative data,
triangulation,
black box evaluations,

hypothesis,"Every quantitative research question should be stated as a pair of null and alternative hypotheses, which must be mutually exclusive. After collecting data and testing these hypotheses, we can either (1) reject the null hypothesis or (2) fail to reject the null hypothesis. We can never â€œproveâ€ù or â€œacceptâ€ù the null hypothesis."
