    "section": "\n1.1 Philosophical approaches to p-values",
    "text": "1.1 Philosophical approaches to p-values\nBefore we look at how p-values are computed, it is important to examine how they are supposed to help us make ordinal claims when testing hypotheses. The definition of a p-value is the probability of observing the sample data, or more extreme data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. But this definition does not tell us much about how we should interpret a p-value.\nThe interpretation of a p-value depends on the statistical philosophy one subscribes to. Ronald Fisher published ‘Statistical Methods for Research Workers’ in 1925 which popularized the use of p-values. In a Fisherian framework a p-value is interpreted as a descriptive continuous measure of compatibility between the observed data and the null hypothesis (Greenland et al., 2016). The compatibility of observed data with the null model falls between 1 (perfectly compatible) and 0 (extremely incompatible), and every individual can interpret the p-value with “statistical thoughtfulness”. According to Fisher (1956), p-values “do not generally lead to any probability statement about the real world, but to a rational and well-defined measure of the reluctance to accept the hypotheses they test”. Fisher tried to formalize his philosophy in an approach called ‘fiducial inference’, but this has not received the same widespread adoption of other approaches, such as decision theory, likelihoods, and Bayesian inference. Indeed, Zabell (1992) writes “The fiducial argument stands as Fisher’s one great failure”, although others have expressed the hope that it might be developed into a useful approach in the future (Schweder & Hjort, 2016). A Fisherian p-value describes the incompatibility of the data with a single hypothesis, and is known as significance testing. The main reason a significance test is limited is because researchers only specify a null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)), but not the alternative hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)).\nNeyman and Pearson (1933) built on insights about p-values by William Gosset and Ronald Fisher, and developed an approach called statistical hypothesis testing. The main difference with the significance testing approach developed by Fisher was that in a statistical hypothesis test both a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis is specified. In a Neyman-Pearson framework, the goal of statistical tests is to guide the behavior of researchers with respect to these two hypotheses. Based on the results of a statistical test, and without ever knowing whether the hypothesis is true or not, researchers choose to tentatively act as if the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis is true. In psychology, researchers often use an imperfect hybrid of the Fisherian and Neyman-Pearson frameworks, but the Neyman-Pearson approach is, according to Dienes (2008) “the logic underlying all the statistics you see in the professional journals of psychology”.\nWhen a Neyman-Pearson hypothesis test is performed, the observed p-value is only used to check if it is smaller than the chosen alpha level, but it does not matter how much smaller it is. For example, if an alpha level of 0.01 is used, both a p = 0.006 and a p = 0.000001 will lead researchers to decide to act as if the state of the world is best described by the alternative hypothesis. This differs from a Fisherian approach to p-values, where the lower the p-value, the greater the psychological reluctance of a researcher to accept the null hypothesis they are testing. A Neyman-Pearson hypothesis test does not see the goal of an inference as quantifying a continuous measure of compatibility or evidence. Instead, as Neyman (1957) writes:\n\nThe content of the concept of inductive behavior is the recognition that the purpose of every piece of serious research is to provide grounds for the selection of one of several contemplated courses of action.\n\nIntuitively, one might feel that decisions about how to act should not be based on the results of a single statistical test, and this point is often raised as a criticism of a Neyman-Pearson approach to statistical inferences. However, such criticisms rarely use the same definition of an ‘act’ as Neyman used. It is true that, for example, the decision to implement a new government policy should not be based on a single study result. However, Neyman considered making a scientific claim an ‘act’ as well, and wrote (1957, p. 10) that the concluding phase of a study involves:\n\nan act of will or a decision to take a particular action, perhaps to assume a particular attitude towards the various sets of hypotheses\n\nCox (1958) writes:\n\nit might be argued that in making an inference we are ‘deciding’ to make a statement of a certain type about the populations and that therefore, provided that the word decision is not interpreted too narrowly, the study of statistical decisions embraces that of inference. The point here is that one of the main general problems of statistical inference consists in deciding what types of statement can usefully be made and exactly what they mean.\n\nThus, in a Neyman-Pearson approach, p-values form the basis of decisions about which claims to make. In science, such claims underlie most novel experiments in the form of auxiliary hypotheses, or the assumptions about underlying hypotheses that are assumed to be accurate in order for a test to work as planned (Hempel, 1966). For example, if it is important that participants can see color in a planned experiment, we assume it is true that the Ishihara test successfully identifies which participants are colorblind."

    "text": "1.2 Creating a null model\nAssume I ask two groups of 10 people how much they liked the extended directors cut of the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) trilogy. This means our total sample size (N) is 20, and the sample size in each group (n) is 10. The first group consists of my friends, and the second groups consists of friends of my wife. Our friends rate the trilogy on a score from 1 to 10. We can calculate the average rating by my friends, which is 8.7, and the average rating by my wife’s friends, which is 7.7. We can compare the scores in both groups by looking at the raw data, and by plotting the data.\n\n\n\nRatings for the Lord of the Rings extended trilogy by two groups of friends.\n\n\nFriends Daniel\nFriends Kyra\n\n\n\nfriend_1\n9\n9\n\n\nfriend_2\n7\n6\n\n\nfriend_3\n8\n7\n\n\nfriend_4\n9\n8\n\n\nfriend_5\n8\n7\n\n\nfriend_6\n9\n9\n\n\nfriend_7\n9\n8\n\n\nfriend_8\n10\n8\n\n\nfriend_9\n9\n8\n\n\nfriend_10\n9\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see the groups overlap but the mean ratings differ by 1 whole point. The question we are now faced with is the following: Is the difference between the two groups just random variation, or can we claim that my friends like the extended directors cut of the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) trilogy more than my wife’s friends?\nIn a null hypothesis significance test we try to answer this question by calculating the probability of the observed difference (in this case, a mean difference of 1) or a more extreme difference, under the assumption that there is no real difference between how much my friends and my wife’s friends like the extended directors cut of LOTR, and we are just looking at random noise. This probability is called the p-value. If this probability is low enough, we decide to claim there is a difference. If this probability is not low enough, we refrain from making a claim about a difference.\nThe null hypothesis assumes that if we would ask an infinite number of my friends and an infinite number of my wife’s friends how much they like LOTR, the difference between these huge groups is exactly 0. However, in any sample drawn from the population, random variation is very likely to lead to a difference somewhat larger or smaller than 0. We can create a null model that quantifies the expected variation in the observed data, just due to random noise, to tell us what constitutes a reasonable expectation about how much the differences between groups can vary if there is no difference in the population.\nIt is practical to create a null model in terms of a standardized distribution, as this makes it easier to calculate the probability that specific values will occur, regardless of the scale that is used to collect the measurements. One version of a null model for differences is the t-distribution, which can be used to describe which differences should be expected when drawing samples from a population. Such a null model is built on assumptions. In the case of the t-distribution, the assumption is that scores are normally distributed. In reality, the assumptions upon which statistical methods are built are never met perfectly, which is why statisticians examine the impact of violations of assumptions on methodological procedures. Statistical tests are still useful in practice when the impact of violations on statistical inferences is small enough.\nWe can quantify the distribution of t-values that is expected when there is no difference in the population by a probability density function. Below is a plot of the probability density function for a t-distribution with 18 degrees of freedom (df), which corresponds to our example where we collect data from 20 friends (df = N - 2 for two independent groups). For a continuous distribution, where probabilities are defined for an infinite number of points, the probability of observing any single point (e.g., t = 2.5) is always zero. Probabilities are measured over intervals. For this reason, when a p-value is computed, it is not defined as ‘the probability of observing the data’, but as ‘the probability of observing the data, or more extreme data’. This creates an interval (a tail of a distribution) for which a probability can be calculated."

    "section": "\n1.4 Which p-values can you expect?",
    "text": "1.4 Which p-values can you expect?\nIn a very educational video about the ‘Dance of the p-values’, Geoff Cumming explains that p-values vary from experiment to experiment. However, this is not a reason to ‘not trust p’ as he mentions in the video. Instead, it is important to clearly understand p-value distributions to prevent misconceptions. Because p-values are part of frequentist statistics, we need to examine what we can expect in the long run. Because we never do the same experiment hundreds of times, and we do only a very limited number of studies in our lifetime, the best way to learn about what we should expect in the long run is through computer simulations.\nTake a moment to try to answer the following two questions. Which p-values can you expect to observe if there is a true effect, and you repeat the same study one-hundred thousand times? And which p-values can you expect if there is no true effect, and you repeat the same study one-hundred thousand times? If you don’t know the answer, don’t worry - you will learn it now. But if you don’t know the answer, it is worth reflecting on why you don’t know the answer about such an essential aspect of p-values. If you are like me, you were simply never taught this. But as we will see, it is essential to a solid understanding of how to interpret p-values.\nWhich p-values you can expect is completely determined by the statistical power of the study, or the probability that you will observe a significant effect, if there is a true effect. The statistical power ranges from 0 to 1. We can illustrate this by simulating independent t-tests. The idea is that we simulate IQ scores for a group of people. We know the standard deviation of IQ scores is 15. For now, we will set the mean IQ score in one simulated group to 100, and in the other simulated group to 105. We are testing if the people in one group have an IQ that differs from the other group (and we know the correct answer is ‘yes’, because we made it so in the simulation).\n\np &lt;- numeric(100000) # store all simulated *p*-values\n\nfor (i in 1:100000) { # for each simulated experiment\n  x &lt;- rnorm(n = 71, mean = 100, sd = 15) # Simulate data\n  y &lt;- rnorm(n = 71, mean = 105, sd = 15) # Simulate data\n  p[i] &lt;- t.test(x, y)$p.value # store the *p*-value\n}\n\n(sum(p &lt; 0.05) / 100000) # compute power\n\nhist(p, breaks = 20) # plot a histogram\n\nIn the simulation, we generate n = 71 normally distributed IQ scores with means of M (100 and 105 by default) and a standard deviation of 15. We then perform an independent t-test, store the p-value, and generate a plot of the p-value distribution.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Distribution of p-values when power = 50%.\n\n\n\n\nOn the x-axis we see p-values from 0 to 1 in 20 bars, and on the y-axis we see how frequently these p-values were observed. There is a horizontal red dotted line that indicates an alpha of 5% (located at a frequency of 100.000*0.05 = 5000) – but you can ignore this line for now. In the title of the graph, the statistical power that is achieved in the simulated studies is given (assuming an alpha of 0.05): The studies have 50% power.\nThe simulation result illustrates the probability density function of p-values fot a t-test. A probability density function provides the probability that a random variable has a specific value (such as Figure 1.1) of the t-distribution). Because the p-value is a random variable, we can use its probability density function to plot the p-value distribution (Hung et al., 1997; Ulrich & Miller, 2018), as in Figure 1.3). In this online Shiny app you can vary the sample size, effect size, and alpha level to examine the effect on the p-value distribution. Increasing the sample size or the effect size will increase the steepness of the p-value distribution, which means that the probability to observe small p-values increases. The p-value distribution is a function of the statistical power of the test.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Probability density function for p-values from a two-sided t-test.\n\n\n\n\nWhen there is no true effect, and test assumptions are met, p-values for a t-test are uniformly distributed. This means that every p-value is equally likely to be observed when the null hypothesis is true. In other words, when there is no true effect, a p-value of 0.08 is just as likely as a p-value of 0.98. I remember thinking this was very counterintuitive when I first learned about uniform p-value distributions (well after completing my PhD). But it makes sense that p-values are uniformly distributed when we think about the goal to guarantee that when \\(H_0\\) is true, alpha % of the p-values should fall below the alpha level. If we set alpha to 0.01, 1% of the observed p-values should fall below 0.01, and if we set alpha to 0.12, 12% of the observed p-values should fall below 0.12. This can only happen if p-values are uniformly distributed when the null hypothesis is true. Note that the uniform p-value distribution only emerges if the distribution of the test statistic is continuous (e.g., such as for the t-test), and not if the distribution of the test statistic is discrete (e.g., in the case of the chi-squared test, see Wang et al. (2019)).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Distribution of p-values when the null hypothesis is true."

    "text": "1.5 Lindley’s paradox\nAs the statistical power increases, some p-values below 0.05 (e.g., p = 0.04) can be more likely when there is no effect than when there is an effect. This is known as Lindley’s paradox (Lindley, 1957), or sometimes the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox (Spanos, 2013). Because the distribution of p-values is a function of the statistical power (Cumming, 2008), the higher the power, the more right-skewed the p-value distribution becomes (i.e., the more likely it becomes that small p-values are observed). When there is no true effect, p-values are uniformly distributed, and 1% of observed p-values fall between 0.04 and 0.05. When the statistical power is extremely high, not only will most p-values fall below 0.05, most p-values will fall below 0.01. In Figure 1.5) we see that with high power very small p-values (e.g., 0.001) are more likely to be observed when there is an effect than when there is no effect (e.g., the dotted black curve representing 99% power falls above the grey horizontal line representing the uniform distribution when the null is true for a p-value of 0.01).\nYet perhaps surprisingly, observing a p-value of 0.04 is more likely when the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) is true than when the alternative hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)) is true and we have very high power, as illustrated by the fact that in Figure 1.5) the density of the p-value distribution is higher when the null is true, than when a test has 99% power, at 0.04. Lindley’s paradox shows that a p-value of for example 0.04 can be statistically significant, but at the same time provides evidence for the null hypothesis. From a Neyman-Pearson approach we have made a claim that has a maximum error rate of 5%, but from a likelihood or Bayesian approach, we should conclude our data provides evidence in favor of the null hypothesis, relative to the alternative hypothesis. Lindley’s paradox illustrates when different statistical philosophies would reach different conclusions, and why a p-value cannot directly be interpreted as a measure of evidence, without taking the power of the test into account. Although it is not necessary, researchers might desire to prevent situations where a frequentist rejects the null hypothesis based on p &lt; 0.05, when the evidence in the test favors the null hypothesis over the alternative hypothesis. This can be achieved by lowering the alpha level as a function of the sample size (Good, 1992; Leamer, 1978; Maier & Lakens, 2022), as explained in the chapter on error control.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: P-value distribution for 0 (grey horizontal line, 50 percent power (black solid curve), and 99 percent power (black dotted curve, where p-values just below 0.05 are more likely when \\(H_0\\) is true than when \\(H_1\\) is true)."

    "text": "1.6 Correctly reporting and interpreting p-values\nAlthough from a strict Neyman-Pearson perspective it is sufficient to report that p &lt; \\(\\alpha\\) or that p &gt; \\(\\alpha\\), researchers should report exact p-values. This facilitates the re-use of results for secondary analyses (Appelbaum et al., 2018), and allows other researchers to compare the p-value to an alpha level they would have preferred to use (Lehmann & Romano, 2005). Because claims are made using a methodological procedure with known maximum error rates, a p-value never allows you state anything with certainty. Even if we set the alpha level to 0.000001 any single claim can be an error, Fisher (1935) reminds us, ‘for the “one chance in a million” will undoubtedly occur, with no less and no more than its appropriate frequency, however surprised we may be that it should occur to us”. This is the reason that replication studies are important in science. Any single finding could be a fluke, but this probability quickly becomes very small if several replication studies observe the same finding. This uncertainty is sometimes not reflected in academic writing, where researchers can be seen using words as ’prove’, ‘show’, or ‘it is known’. A slightly longer but more accurate statement after a hypothesis test would read:\n\nWe claim there is a/no meaningful effect, while acknowledging that if scientists make claims using this methodological procedure, they will be misled, in the long run, at most alpha % or beta % of the time, which we deem acceptable. We will for the foreseeable future, until new data or information emerges that proves us wrong, assume this claim is correct.\n\nRemember that in a Neyman-Pearson framework researchers make claims, but do not necessarily believe in the truth of these claims. For example, the OPERA collaboration reported in 2011 that they had observed data that seemed to suggest neutrinos traveled faster than the speed of light. This claim was made with a with a 0.2-in-a-million Type 1 error rate, assuming the error was purely due to random noise. However, none of the researchers actually believed this claim was true, because it is theoretically impossible for neutrinos to move faster than the speed of light. Indeed, it was later confirmed that equipment failures were the cause of the anomalous data: a fiber optic cable had been attached improperly, and a clock oscillator was ticking too fast. Nevertheless, the claim was made with the explicit invitation to the scientific community to provide new data or information that would prove this claim wrong.\nWhen researchers “accept” or “reject” a hypothesis in a Neyman-Pearson approach to statistical inferences, they do not communicate any belief or conclusion about the substantive hypothesis. Instead, they utter a Popperian basic statement based on a prespecified decision rule that the observed data reflect a certain state of the world. Basic statements describe an observation that has been made (e.g., “I have observed a black swan”) or an event that has occurred (e.g., “students performed better at the exam when being trained in spaced practice, than when not”).\nThe claim is about the data we have observed, but not about the theory we used to make predictions. The claim is about observed data, as it is a statistical inference, and not about the theory, which requires a theoretical inference. Data never ‘proves’ a theory is true or false. A basic statement can corroborate a prediction derived from a theory, or not. If many predictions deduced from a theory are corroborated, we can become increasingly convinced the theory is close to the truth. This ‘truth-likeness’ of theories is called verisimilitude (Niiniluoto, 1998; Popper, 2002). A shorter statement when a hypothesis test is presented would therefore read ‘p = .xx, which corroborates our prediction, at an alpha level of y%’, or ‘p = .xx, which does not corroborate our prediction, at a statistical power of y% for our effect size of interest’. Often, the alpha level or the statistical power is only mentioned in the experimental design section of an article, but repeating them in the results section might remind readers of the error rates associated with your claims.\nEven when we have made correct claims, the underlying theory can be false. Popper (2002) reminds us that “The empirical basis of objective science has thus nothing ‘absolute’ basis about it”. He argues science is not built on a solid bedrock, but on piles driven in a swamp and notes that “We simply stop when we are satisfied that the piles are firm enough to carry the structure, at least for the time being.” As Hacking (1965) writes: “Rejection is not refutation. Plenty of rejections must be only tentative.” So when we reject the null model, we do so tentatively, aware of the fact we might have done so in error, without necessarily believing the null model is false, and without believing the theory we have used to make predictions is true. For Neyman (1957) inferential behavior is an: “act of will to behave in the future (perhaps until new experiments are performed) in a particular manner, conforming with the outcome of the experiment”. All knowledge in science is provisional.\nSome statisticians recommend interpreting p-values as measures of evidence. For example, Bland (2015) teaches that p-values can be interpreted as a ‘rough and ready’ guide for the strength of evidence, and that p &gt; 0.1 indicates ‘little or no evidence’, 0.01 &lt; p &lt; 0.05 indicates ‘evidence’, p &lt; 0.001 is ‘very strong evidence’. This is incorrect (Johansson, 2011; Lakens, 2022), as is clear from the previous discussions of Lindley’s paradox and uniform p-value distributions. If you want to quantify evidence, see the chapters on likelihoods or Bayesian statistics."

    "text": "1.7 Preventing common misconceptions about p-values\nA p-value is the probability of the observed data, or more extreme data, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. To understand what this means, it might be especially useful to know what this doesn’t mean. First, we need to know what ‘the assumption that the null hypothesis is true’ looks like, and which data we should expect if the null hypothesis is true. Although the null hypothesis can be any value, in this assignment we will assume the null hypothesis is specified as a mean difference of 0. For example, we might be interested in calculating the difference between a control condition and an experimental condition on a dependent variable.\nIt is useful to distinguish the null hypothesis (the prediction that the mean difference in the population is exactly 0) and the null model (a model of the data we should expect when we collect data when the null hypothesis is true). The null hypothesis is a point at 0, but the null model is a distribution. It is visualized in textbooks or power analysis software using pictures as you can see below, with t-values on the horizontal axis, and a critical t-value somewhere between 1.96 – 2.00 (depending on the sample size). This is done because the statistical test when comparing two groups is based on the t-distribution, and the p-value is statistically significant when the t-value is larger than a critical t-value.\nI personally find things become a lot clearer if you plot the null model as mean differences instead of t-values. So below, you can see a null model for the mean differences we can expect when comparing two groups of 50 observations where the true difference between the two groups is 0, and the standard deviation in each group is 1. Because the standard deviation is 1, you can also interpret the mean differences as a Cohen’s d effect size. So this is also the distribution you can expect for a Cohen’s d of 0, when collecting 50 observations per group in an independent t-test.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Distribution of observed Cohen’s d effect sizes when collecting 50 observations per group in an independent t-test.\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing to notice is that we expect that the mean of the null model is 0. Looking at the x-axis, we see the plotted distribution is centered on 0. But even if the mean difference in the population is 0 that does not imply every sample we draw from the population will give a mean difference of exactly zero. There is variation around the population value, as a function of the standard deviation and the sample size.\nThe y-axis of the graph represents the density, which provides an indication of the relative likelihood of measuring a particular value of a continuous distribution. We can see that the most likely mean difference is the true population value of zero, and that larger differences from zero become increasingly less likely. The graph has two areas that are colored red. These areas represent 2.5% of the most extreme values in the left tail of the distribution, and 2.5% of the most extreme values in the right tail of the distribution. Together, they make up 5% of the most extreme mean differences we would expect to observe, given our number of observations, when the true mean difference is exactly 0. When a mean difference in the red area is observed, the corresponding statistical test will be statistically significant at a 5% alpha level. In other words, not more than 5% of the observed mean differences will be far enough away from 0 to be considered surprising. Because the null hypothesis is true, observing a ‘surprising’ mean difference in the red areas is a Type 1 error.\nLet’s assume that the null model in the Figure above is true, and that we observe a mean difference of 0.5 between the two groups. This observed difference falls in the red area in the right tail of the distribution. This means that the observed mean difference is relatively surprising, under the assumption that the true mean difference is 0. If the true mean difference is 0, the probability density functions shows that we should not expect a mean difference of 0.5 very often. If we calculate a p-value for this observation, it would be lower than 5%. The probability of observing a mean difference that is at least as far away from 0 as 0.5 (either to the left from the mean, or to the right, when we do a two-tailed test) is less than 5%.\nOne reason why I prefer to plot the null model in raw scores instead of t-values is that you can see how the null model changes when the sample size increases. When we collect 5000 instead of 50 observations, we see the null model is still centered on 0 – but in our null model we now expect most values will fall very close around 0.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Distribution of observed Cohen’s d effect sizes when collecting 5000 observations per group in an independent t-test when d = 0.\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution is much narrower because the distribution of mean differences is based on the standard error of the difference between means. This value is calculated based on the standard deviation and the sample size, as follows:\n\\[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}}+\\frac{\\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}}}\\]\nThis formula shows that the standard deviations of each group (σ) are squared and divided by the sample size of that group, added together, after which the square root is taken. The larger the sample size the bigger the number we divide by, and thus the smaller standard error of the difference between means. In our n = 50 example this is:\n\\[\\sqrt{\\frac{1^{2}}{50}+\\frac{1^{2}}{50}}\\]\nThe standard error of the differences between means is thus 0.2 for n = 50 in each group, and for n = 5000 it is 0.02. Assuming a normal distribution, 95% of the observations fall between 1.96 SE. So for 50 samples per group, the mean differences should fall between -1.96 * 0.2 = -0.392, and +1.96 * 0.2 = 0.392, and we can see the red areas start from approximately -0.392 to 0.392 for n = 50. For 5000 samples per group, the mean differences should fall between -1.96 * 0.02, and +1.96 * 0.02; in other words between -0.0392 to 0.0392 for n = 5000. Due to the larger sample size with n = 5000 observations per group, we should expect to observe mean differences in our sample closer to 0 compared to our null model when we had only 50 observations.\nIf we collected n = 5000, and we would again observe a mean difference of 0.5, it should be clear that this same difference is even more surprising than it was when we collected 50 observations. We are now almost ready to address common misconceptions about p-values, but before we can do this, we need to introduce a model of the data when the null is not true. If we are not sampling data from a model where the true mean difference is 0, what does our alternative model look like? Some software (such as G*power, see Figure 1.8) will visualize both the null model (red curve) and the alternative model (blue curve) in their output:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Screenshot from G*Power software visualizing the null model (red distribution) and alternative model (blue distribution) and the critical t-value (1.66055) that is the threshold distinguishing significant and non-significant results.\n\n\n\n\nWhen we do a study, we rarely already know what the true mean difference is (if we already knew, why would we do the study?). But let’s assume there is an all-knowing entity. Following Paul Meehl, we will call this all-knowing entity ‘Omniscient Jones’. Before we collect our sample of 50 observations, Omniscient Jones already knows that the true mean difference in the population is 0.5. Again, we should expect some variation around 0.5 in this alternative model. The figure below shows the expected data pattern when the null hypothesis is true (now indicated by a grey line) and it shows an alternative model, assuming a true mean difference of 0.5 exists in the population (indicated by a black line).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: Distribution of observed Cohen’s d effect sizes when collecting 50 observations per group in an independent t-test when d = 0.\n\n\n\n\nBut Omniscient Jones could have said the true difference was much larger. Let’s assume we do another study, but now before we collect our 50 observations, Omniscient Jones tells us that the true mean difference is 1.5. The null model does not change, but the alternative model now moves over to the right.\nYou can play around with the alternative and null models in this online app. The app allows you to specify the sample size in each group of an independent t-test (from 2 to infinity), the mean difference (from 0 to 2), and the alpha level. In the plot, the red areas visualize Type 1 errors. The blue area visualizes the Type 2 error rate (which we will discuss below). The app also tells you the critical value: There is a vertical line (with n = 50 this line falls at a mean difference of 0.4) and a sentence that says: “Effects larger than 0.4 will be statistically significant”. Note that the same is true for effects smaller than -0.4, even though there is no second label there, but the app shows the situation for a two-sided independent t-test.\nYou can see that on the left of the vertical line that indicates the critical mean difference there is a blue area that is part of the alternative model. This is the Type 2 error rate (or 1 - the power of the study). If a study has 80% power, 80% of the mean differences we will observe should fall on the right of the critical value indicated by the line. If the alternative model is true, but we observe an effect smaller than the critical value, the observed p-value will be larger than 0.05, even when there is a true effect. You can check in the app that the larger the sample size, the further to the right the entire alternative distribution falls, and thus the higher the power. You can also see that the larger the sample size, the narrower the distribution, and the less of the distribution will fall below the critical value (as long as the true population mean is larger than the critical value). Finally, the larger the alpha level, the further to the left the critical mean difference moves, and the smaller the area of the alternative distribution that falls below the critical value.\nThe app also plots 3 graphs that illustrate the power curves as a function of different alpha levels, sample sizes, or true mean differences. Play around in the app by changing the values. Get a feel for how each variable impacts the null and alternative models, the mean difference that will be statistically significant, and the Type 1 and Type 2 error rates.\nSo far, several aspects of null models should have become clear. First of all, the population value in a traditional null hypothesis is a value of 0, but in any sample you draw, the observed difference falls in a distribution centered on 0, and will thus most often be slightly larger or smaller than 0. Second, the width of this distribution depends on the sample size and the standard deviation. The larger the sample size in the study, the narrower the distribution will be around 0. Finally, when a mean difference is observed that falls in the tails of the null model, this can be considered surprising. The further away from the null value, the more surprising this result is. But when the null model is true, these surprising values will happen with a probability specified by the alpha level (and are called Type 1 errors). Remember that a Type 1 error occurs when a researcher concludes there is a difference in the population, while the true mean difference in the population is zero.\nWe are now finally ready to address some common misconceptions about p-values. Let’s go through a list of common misconceptions that have been reported in the scientific literature. Some of these examples might sound like semantics. It is easy to at first glance think that the statement communicates the right idea, even if the written version is not formally correct. However, when a statement is not formally correct, it is wrong. And exactly because people so often misunderstand p-values, it is worth it to be formally correct about how they should be interpreted.\n\n1.7.1 Misunderstanding 1: A non-significant p-value means that the null hypothesis is true.\nA common version of this misconception is reading a sentence such as ‘because p &gt; 0.05 we can conclude that there is no effect’. Another version of such a sentence is ‘there was no difference, (p &gt; 0.05)’.\nBefore we look at this misconception in some detail, I want to remind you of one fact that is easy to remember, and will enable you to recognize many misconceptions about p-values: p-values are a statement about the probability of data, not a statement about the probability of a hypothesis or the probability of a theory. Whenever you see p-values interpreted as a probability of a theory or a hypothesis, you know something is not right. Examples of statements about a hypothesis are ‘The null hypothesis is true’, or ‘The alternative hypothesis is true’, because both these statements say that the probability that the null or alternative model is true is 100%. A subtler version is a statement such as ‘the observed difference is not due to chance’. The observed difference is only ‘due to chance’ (instead of due to the presence of a real difference) when the null hypothesis is true, and as before, this statement implies it is 100% probable that the null hypothesis is true.\nWhen you conclude that ‘there is no effect’ or that ‘there is no difference’ you are similarly claiming that it is 100% probable that the null hypothesis is true. But since p-values are statements about the probability of data, you should refrain from making statements about the probability of a theory solely based on a p-value. That’s ok. p-values were designed to help you identify surprising results from a noisy data generation process (aka the real world). They were not designed to quantify the probability that a hypothesis is true.\nLet’s take a concrete example that will illustrate why a non-significant result does not mean that the null hypothesis is true. In the figure below, Omniscient Jones tells us the true mean difference is 0.5. We can see this, because the alternative distribution which visualizes the probability of the mean differences we should expect when the alternative hypothesis is true is centered on 0.5. We have observed a mean difference of 0.35. This value is not extreme enough to be statistically different from 0. We can see this, because the value does not fall within the red area of the null model (and hence, the p-value is not smaller than our alpha level).\nNevertheless, we see that observing a mean difference of 0.35 is not only quite likely given that the true mean difference is 0.5, but observing a mean difference of 0.35 is much more likely under the alternative model than under the null model. You can see this by comparing the height of the density curve at a difference of 0.35 for the null model, which is approximately 0.5, and the height of the density curve for the alternative model, which is approximately 1.5. See the chapter on likelihoods for further details.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10: Distribution of observed Cohen’s d effect sizes when collecting 50 observations per group in an independent t-test for d = 0 and d = 0.5 when observing d = 0.35.\n\n\n\n\nAll the p-value tells us is that a mean difference of 0.35 is not extremely surprising, if we assume the null hypothesis is true. There can be many reasons for this. In the real world, where we have no Omniscient Jones to tell us about the true mean difference, it is possible that there is a true effect, as illustrated in the figure above.\nSo what should we say instead? The solution is subtle, but important. Let’s revisit the two examples of incorrect statements we made earlier. First, ‘because p &gt; 0.05 we can conclude that there is no effect’ is incorrect, because there might very well be an effect (and remember p-values are statements about data, not about the probability that there is an effect or is no effect). Fisher’s interpretation of a p-value was that we can conclude a rare event has happened, or that the null hypothesis is false (he writes literally: “Either an exceptionally rare chance has occurred, or the theory of random distribution is not true”). This might sound like it is a statement about the probability of a theory, but it is really just stating the two possible scenarios under which low p-values occur (when you have made a Type 1 error, or when the alternative hypothesis is true). Both a true positive as a false positive remain possible, and we do not quantify the probability of either possible reality (e.g., we are not saying it is 95% probable that the null hypothesis is false). From a Neyman-Pearson perspective, a p &gt; .05 means that we cannot act as if the null hypothesis can be rejected, without maintaining our desired error rate of 5%.\nIf you are interested in concluding an effect is absent, null hypothesis testing is not the tool to use. A null hypothesis test answers the question ‘can I reject the null hypothesis with a desired error rate?’. If you cannot do this, and p &gt; 0.05, no conclusion can be drawn based only on the p-value (remember the concept of 無 ‘mu’: the answer is neither yes nor no). Luckily, statistical approaches have been developed to ask questions about the absence of an effect such as equivalence testing, Bayes factors, and Bayesian estimation (see Harms & Lakens (2018), for an overview).\nThe second incorrect statement was ‘there was no difference’. This statement is somewhat easier to correct. You can instead write ‘there was no statistically significant difference’. Granted, this is a bit tautological, because you are basically saying that the p-value was larger than the alpha level in two different ways, but at least this statement is formally correct. The difference between ‘there was no difference’ and ‘there was no statistically significant difference’ might sound like semantics, but in the first case you are formally saying ‘the difference was 0’ while in the second you are saying ‘there was no difference large enough to yield a p &lt; .05’. Although I have never seen anyone do this, a more informative message might be ‘because given our sample size of 50 per group, and our alpha level of 0.05, only observed differences more extreme than 0.4 could be statistically significant, and our observed mean difference was 0.35 thus we could not reject the null hypothesis’. If this feels like a very unsatisfactory conclusion, remember that a null hypothesis test was not designed to draw interesting conclusions about the absence of effects – you will need to learn about equivalence tests to get a more satisfactory answers about null effects.\n\n1.7.2 Misunderstanding 2: A significant p-value means that the null hypothesis is false.\nThis is the opposite misconception from the one we discussed previously. Examples of incorrect statements based on this misconception are ‘p &lt; .05, therefore there is an effect’, or ‘there is a difference between the two groups, p &lt; .05’. As before, both these statements imply it is 100% probable that the null model is false, and an alternative model is true.\nAs a simple example of why such extreme statements are incorrect, imagine we generate a series of numbers in R using the following command:\n\nrnorm(n = 50, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n [1] -1.933737354  0.833574776  0.215210384 -1.420298621 -2.173008815\n [6]  0.594572303 -0.755546980  0.013497083 -0.873689147 -0.634266537\n[11]  1.652850563 -0.103092189 -0.825630753 -2.044684944  3.704181152\n[16] -0.554937052  0.660450633  0.814324937 -0.186301010  0.265158994\n[21]  2.119859250  0.310806151 -0.665607760 -0.328149936  0.971384511\n[26]  0.221626172 -0.510990241  1.044466915 -0.470665286 -2.017300062\n[31] -0.111352627 -0.001534238  1.006420761  0.187909622 -0.944293543\n[36] -0.589530823 -0.601660999  0.061614493  1.163750752  2.224886748\n[41] -0.902472138  2.435338239 -0.169003918 -0.951271701  0.886062960\n[46] -1.622608355 -0.802226231  0.459385505  0.138067814  0.660618215\n\n\nThis command generates 50 random observations from a distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (in the long run – the mean and standard deviation will vary in each sample that is generated). Imagine we run this command once, and we observe a mean of 0.5. The figure below visualizes this scenario. We can perform a one-sample t-test against 0, and this test tells us, with a p &lt; .05, that the data we have observed is surprisingly different from 0, assuming the random number generator in R functions as it should and generates data with a true mean of 0.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.11: Distribution of observed Cohen’s d effect sizes when collecting 50 observations per group in an independent t-test when d = 0 and observing d = 0.5.\n\n\n\n\nThe significant p-value does not allow us to conclude that the null hypothesis (“the random number generator works”) is false. It is true that the mean of the 50 samples we generated was surprisingly extreme. But a low p-value simply tells us that an observation is surprising. We should observe such surprising observations with a low probability when the null hypothesis is true – when the null is true, they still happen. Therefore, a significant result does not mean an alternative hypothesis is true – the result can also be a Type 1 error, and in the example above, Omniscient Jones knows that this is the case.\nLet’s revisit the incorrect statement ‘p &lt; .05, therefore there is an effect’. A correct interpretation of a significant p-value requires us to acknowledge the possibility that our significant result might be a Type 1 error. Remember that Fisher would conclude that “Either an exceptionally rare chance has occurred, or the theory of random distribution is not true”. A correct interpretation in terms of Neyman-Pearson statistics would be: “we can act as if the null hypothesis is false, and we would not be wrong more than 5% of the time in the long run”. Note the specific use of the word ‘act’, which does not imply anything about whether this specific hypothesis is true or false, but merely states that if we act as if the null hypothesis is false any time we observe p &lt; alpha, we will not make an error more than alpha percent of the time.\nBoth these formally correct statements are a bit long. In scientific articles, we often read a shorter statement such as: ‘we can reject the null hypothesis’, or ‘we can accept the alternative hypothesis’. These statements might be made with the assumption that readers will themselves add ‘with a 5% probability of being wrong, in the long run’. But it might be useful to add ‘with a 5% long run error rate’ at least the first time you make such a statement in your article to remind readers.\nIn the example above we have a very strong subjective prior probability that the random number generator in R works. Alternative statistical procedures to incorporate such prior beliefs are Bayesian statistics or false positive report probabilities. In frequentist statistics, the idea is that you need to replicate your study several times. You will observe a Type 1 error every now and then, but you are unlikely to observe a Type 1 error three times in a row. Alternatively, you can lower the alpha level in a single study to reduce the probability of a Type 1 error rate.\n\n1.7.3 Misunderstanding 3: A significant p-value means that a practically important effect has been discovered.\nA common concern when interpreting p-values is that ‘significant’ in normal language implies ‘important’, and thus a ‘significant’ effect is interpreted as an ‘important’ effect. However, the question whether an effect is important is completely orthogonal to the question whether it is different from zero, or even how large the effect is. Not all effects have practical impact. The smaller the effect, the less likely such effects will be noticed by individuals, but such effects might still have a large impact on a societal level. Therefore, the general take home message is that statistical significance does not answer the question whether an effect matters in practice, or is ‘practically important’. To answer the question whether an effect matters, you need to present a cost-benefit analysis.\nThis issue of practical significance most often comes up in studies with a very large sample size. As we have seen before, with an increasing sample size, the width of the density distribution around the null value becomes more and more narrow, and the values that are considered surprising fall closer and closer to zero.\nIf we plot the null model for a very large sample size (e.g., n = 10000 per group) we see that even very small mean differences (differences more extreme than a mean difference of 0.04) will be considered ‘surprising’. This still means that if there really is no difference in the population, you will observe differences larger than 0.04 less than 5% of the time, in the long run, and 95% of the observed differences will be smaller than a mean difference of 0.04. But it becomes more difficult to argue for the practical significance of such effects. Imagine that a specific intervention is successful in changing people’s spending behavior, and when implementing some intervention people save 12 cents per year. It is difficult to argue how this effect will make any individual happier. However, if this money is combined, it will yield over 2 million, which could be used to treat diseases in developing countries, where it would have a real impact. The cost of the intervention might be considered too high if the goal is to make individuals happier, but it might be consider worthwhile if the goal is to raise 2 million for charity.\nNot all effects in psychology are additive (we cannot combine or transfer an increase in happiness of 0.04 scale points), so it is often more difficult to argue for the importance of small effects in subjective feelings (Anvari et al., 2021). A cost-benefit analysis might show small effects matter a lot, but whether or not this is the case cannot be inferred from a p-value.\nNote that nothing about this is a problem with the interpretation of a p-value per se: A p &lt; 0.05 still correctly indicates that, if the null hypothesis is true, we have observed data that should be considered surprising. However, just because data is surprising, does not mean we need to care about it. It is mainly the verbal label ‘significant’ that causes confusion here – it is perhaps less confusing to think of a ‘significant’ effect as a ‘surprising’ effect, but not necessarily as an ‘important’ effect.\n\n1.7.4 Misunderstanding 4: If you have observed a significant finding, the probability that you have made a Type 1 error (a false positive) is 5%.\nThis misinterpretation is one possible explanation of the incorrect statement that a p-value is ‘the probability that the data are observed by chance.’ Assume we collect 20 observations, and Omniscient Jones tells us the null hypothesis is true (as in the example above where we generated random numbers in R). This means we are sampling from the distribution in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.12: Distribution of observed Cohen’s d effect sizes when collecting 20 observations per group in an independent t-test when d = 0.\n\n\n\n\nIf this is our reality, it means that 100% of the time that we observe a significant result, it is a false positive (or Type I error). Thus, 100% of our significant results are Type 1 errors.\nIt is important to distinguish probabilities before collecting the data and analyzing the result, and probabilities after collecting data and analyzing the results. What the Type 1 error rate controls is that from all studies we will perform in the future where the null hypothesis is true, not more than 5% of our observed mean differences will fall in the red tail areas. But after we have seen that our data falls in the tail areas with p &lt; alpha, and we know that the null hypothesis is true, these observed significant effects are always a Type 1 error. If you read carefully, you will notice that this misunderstanding is cause by differences in the question that is asked. “If I have observed a p &lt; .05, what is the probability that the null hypothesis is true?” is a different question than “If the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability of observing this (or more extreme) data?”. Only the latter question is answered by a p-value. The first question cannot be answered without making a subjective judgment about the probability that the null hypothesis is true prior to collecting the data.\n\n1.7.5 Misunderstanding 5: One minus the p-value is the probability that the effect will replicate when repeated.\nIt is impossible to calculate the probability that an effect will replicate (Miller, 2009). There are too many unknown factors to accurately predict the replication probability, and one of the main factors is the true mean difference. If we were Omniscient Jones, and we knew the true mean difference (e.g., a difference between the two groups of 0.5 scale points) we would know the statistical power of our test. The statistical power is the probability that we will find a significant result, if the alternative model is true (i.e. if there is a true effect). For example, reading the text in the left bar in the app, we see that with N = 50 per group, alpha level of 0.05, and a true mean difference of 0.5, the probability of finding a significant result (or the statistical power) is 69.69%. If we would observe a significant effect in this scenario (e.g., p = 0.03) it is not true that there is a 97% probability that an exact replication of the study (with the same sample size) would again yield a significant effect. The probability that a study yields a significant effect is determined by the statistical power - not by the p-value in a previous study.\nWhat we can generally take away from this last misunderstanding is the fact that the probability of replication depends on the presence versus the absence of a true effect. In other words, as stated above, if a true effect exists then the level of statistical power informs us about how frequently we should observe a significant result (e.g., 80% power means we should observe significant result 80% of the time). On the other hand, if the null hypothesis is true (e.g., the effect is 0) then significant results will be observed only with a frequency approaching the chosen alpha level in the long run (i.e. a 5% Type 1 error rate if an an alpha of 0.05 is chosen). Therefore, if the original study correctly observed an effect, the probability of a significant result in a replication study is determined by the statistical power, and if the original study correctly observed no significant effect, the probability of a significant effect in a replication study is determined by the alpha level. In practice, many other factors determine if an effect will replicate. The only way to know if an effect will replicate, is to replicate it. If you want to explore how difficult it is to predict if findings in the literature will replicate you can perform this test by 80.000 Hours."

There is a horizontal red dotted line that indicates an alpha of 5% (located at a frequency of 100.000*0.05 = 5000) – but you can ignore this line for now. In the title of the graph, the statistical power that is achieved in the simulated studies is given (assuming an alpha of 0.05): The studies have 50% power (with minor variations for each simulation).\nQ1: Since the statistical power is the probability of observing a statistically significant result, if there is a true effect, we can also see the power in the figure itself. Where?\n\n\nWe can calculate the number of p-values larger than 0.5, and divide them by the number of simulations.We can calculate the number of p-values in the first bar (which contains all 'significant' p-values from 0.00 to 0.05) and divide the p-values in this bar by the total number of simulations.We can calculate the difference between p-values above 0.5 minus the p-values below 0.5, and divide this number by the total number of simulations.We can calculate the difference between p-values above 0.5 minus the p-values below 0.05, and divide this number by the number of simulations.\n\n\nQ2: Change the sample size on line 4 in the code from n &lt;- 26 to n &lt;- 51. Run the simulation by selecting all lines and pressing CTRL+Enter. What is the power in the simulation now that we have increased the sample size from 26 people to 51 people? Remember that simulations can sometimes yield slightly varying answers, so choose the answer option closest to the simulation results.\n\n\n55%60%80%95%\n\n\nQ3: If you look at the distribution of p-values, what do you notice?\n\n\nThe p-value distribution is exactly the same as with 50% powerThe p-value distribution is much steeper than with 50% powerThe p-value distribution is much flatter than with 50% powerThe p-value distribution is much more normally distributed than with 50% power\n\n\nFeel free to increase and decrease the sample size and see what happens if you run the simulation. When you are done exploring, make sure that n &lt;- 51 again in line 4 before you continue.\nQ4: What would happen when there is no true difference between our simulated samples and the average IQ score? In this situation, we have no probability to observe an effect, so you might say we have ‘0 power’. Formally, power is not defined when there is no true effect. However, we can casually refer to this as 0 power. Change the mean in the sample to 100 (set m &lt;- 106 to m &lt;- 100) There is now no difference between the mean in our sample, and the population value we are testing against in the one-sample t-test. Run the script again. What do you notice?\n\n\nThe p-value distribution is exactly the same as with 50% poweThe p-value distribution is much steeper than with 50% powerThe p-value distribution is basically completely flat (ignoring some minor variation due to random noise in the simulation)The p-value distribution is normally (i.e., bell-shaped) distributed\n\n\nThe question below builds on the simulation above where there was no true difference between the groups.\nQ5: Look at the leftmost bar in the plot produced for Q4, and look at the frequency of p-values in this bar. What is the formal name for this bar?\n\n\nThe power (or true positives)The true negativesThe Type 1 error (or false positives)The Type 2 error (or false negatives)\n\n\nLet’s take a look at just the p-values below 0.05. Bear with me for the next few steps – it will be worth it. Find the variable that determines how many bars there are, in the statement bars &lt;- 20 in line 8. Change it to bars &lt;- 100. We will now get 1 bar for p-values between 0 and 0.01, one bar for p-values between 0.01 and 0.02, and 100 bars in total. The red dotted line will now indicate the frequency of p-values when the null hypothesis is true, where every bar contains 1% of the total number of p-values. We only want to look at p-values below 0.05, and we will cut off the plot at 0.05. Change xlim = c(0, 1) to xlim = c(0, 0.05). Instead of seeing all p-values between 0 and 1, we will only see p-values between 0 and 0.05. Re-run the simulation (still with m &lt;- 100). We see the same uniform distribution, but now every bar contains 1% of the p-values, so the p-value distribution is very flat and almost impossible to see (we will zoom in on the y-axis later this assignment). The red line now clearly gives the frequency for each bar, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\nChange the mean in the simulation in line 3 to m &lt;- 107 (remember n is still 51). Re-run the simulation. It’s clear we have very high power. Most p-values are in the left-most bar, which contains all p-values between 0.00 and 0.01.\nQ6: The plot from the last simulation tells you we have approximately 90.5% power (the number in your simulation might vary a bit due to random variation). This is the power if we use an alpha of 5%. But we can also use an alpha of 1%. What is the statistical power we have in the simulated studies when we would use an alpha of 1%, looking at the graph? Pick the answer closest to the answer from your simulations. Note that you can also compute the power for an alpha of 0.01 by changing p &lt; 0.05 to p &lt; 0.01 in line 15, just make sure to set it back to 0.05 before your continue.\n\n\n~90%~75%~50%~5%\n\n\nTo be able to look at the p-values around 0.03 and 0.04, we will zoom in on the y-axis as well. In the part of the code where the plot is draw, change ylim = c(0, nSims) to ylim = c(0, 10000). Re-run the script.\nChange the mean in the sample to 108 in m &lt;- 108), and leave the sample size at 51. Run the simulation. Look at how the distribution has changed compared to the graph above.\nLook at the fifth bar from the left. This bar now contains all the p-values between 0.04 and 0.05. You will notice something peculiar. Remember that the red dotted line indicates the frequency in each bar, assuming the null hypothesis is true. See how the bar with p-values between 0.04 and 0.05 is lower than the red line. We have simulated studies with 96% power. When power is very high, p-values between 0.04 and 0.05 are very rare – they occur less than 1% of the time (most p-values are smaller than 0.01). When the null hypothesis is true, p-values between 0.04 and 0.05 occur exactly 1% of the time (because p-values are uniformly distributed). Now ask yourself: When you have very high power, and you observe a p-value between 0.04 and 0.05, is it more likely that the null hypothesis is true, or that the alternative hypothesis is true? Given that you are more likely to observe p-values between 0.04 and 0.05 when the null hypothesis is true, than when the alternative hypothesis is true, you should interpret a p-value significant with an alpha of 0.05 as more likely when the null hypothesis is true, than when the alternative hypothesis is true.\nIn our simulations, we know there is a true effect or not, but in the real world, you don’t know. When you have very high power, use an alpha level of 0.05, and find a p-value of p = .045, the data is surprising, assuming the null hypothesis is true, but it is even more surprising, assuming the alternative hypothesis is true. This shows how a significant p-value is not always evidence for the alternative hypothesis.\nQ7: When you know you have very high (e.g., 98%) power for the smallest effect size you care about, and you observe a p-value of 0.045, what is the correct conclusion?\n\n\nThe effect is significant, and provides strong support for the alternative hypothesis.The effect is significant, but it is without any doubt a Type 1 error.With high power, you should use an alpha level that is smaller than 0.05, and therefore, this effect cannot be considered significant. The effect is significant, but the data are more likely under the null hypothesis than under the alternative hypothesis.\n\n\nQ8: Play around with the sample size (n) and the mean (m) by changing the numerical values or both (and thus, vary the statistical power in the simulated studies). Look at the simulation result for the bar that contains p-values between 0.04 and 0.05. The red line indicates how many p-values would be found in this bar if the null hypothesis was true (and is always at 1%). At the very best, how much more likely is a p-value between 0.04 and 0.05 to come from a p-value distribution representing a true effect, than it is to come from a p-value distribution when there is no effect? You can answer this question by seeing how much higher the bar of p-values between 0.04 and 0.05 can become. If at best the bar in the simulation is five times as high at the red line (so the bar shows 5% of p-values end up between 0.04 and 0.05, while the red line remains at 1%), then at best p-values between 0.04 and 0.05 are five times as likely when there is a true effect than when there is no true effect.\n\n\nAt best, p-values between 0.04 and 0.05 are equally likely under the alternative hypothesis, and under the null hypothesis.At best, p-values between 0.04 and 0.05 are approximately 4 times more likely under the alternative hypothesis, than under the null hypothesis.At best, p-values between 0.04 and 0.05 are ~10 times more likely under the alternative hypothesis, than under the null hypothesis.At best, p-values between 0.04 and 0.05 are ~30 times more likely under the alternative hypothesis, than under the null hypothesis.\n\n\nFor this reason, statisticians warn that p-values just below 0.05 (e.g., between 0.04 and 0.05) are at the very best weak support for the alternative hypothesis. If you find p-values in this range, consider replicating the study, or if that’s not possible, interpret the result at least a bit cautiously. Of course, you can make a claim in a Neyman-Pearson approach that has at most a 5% Type 1 error rate. The Lindley’s paradox therefore nicely illustrates the difference between different philosophical approaches to statistical inferences.\n\n1.8.2 Questions about p-value misconceptions\nAnswer each question. Then click the ‘Show Answers’ button at the bottom of this set of questions to check which questions you answered correctly.\nQ1: When the sample size in each group of an independent t-test is 50 observations (see Figure 1.6), which statement is correct?\n\n\nThe mean of the differences you will observe between the two groups is always 0.The mean of the differences you will observe between the two groups is always different from 0.Observing a mean difference of +0.5 or -0.5 is considered surprising, assuming the null hypothesis is true.Observing a mean difference of +0.1 or -0.1 is considered surprising, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n\n\nQ2: In what sense are the null models in Figure 1.6 and Figure 1.7 similar, and in what sense are they different?\n\n\nIn both cases, the distributions are centered on zero, and the critical t-value is between 1.96 and 2 (for a two-sided test, depending on the sample size). But the larger the sample size, the closer to 0 the mean differences fall that are considered ‘surprising’.In both cases, a t-value of 0 is the most likely outcome, but the critical t-value is around 0.4 for n = 50, and around 0.05 for n = 5000.In both cases, means will vary in exactly the same way around 0, but the Type 1 error rate is much smaller when n = 5000 than when n = 50.Because the standard error is much larger for n = 50 than for n = 5000, it is much more likely that the null hypothesis is true for n = 50.\n\n\nQ3: You can play around with the alternative and null models in this online app: http://shiny.ieis.tue.nl/d_p_power/. The app allows you to specify the sample size in each group of an independent t-test (from 2 to infinity), the mean difference (from 0 to 2), and the alpha level. In the plot, the red areas visualize Type 1 errors. The blue area visualizes the Type 2 error rate. The app also tells you the critical value: There is a vertical line (with n = 50 this line falls at a mean difference of 0.4) and a verbal label that says: “Effects larger than 0.4 will be statistically significant”. Note that the same is true for effects smaller than -0.4, even though there is no second label there, but the app shows the situation for a two-sided independent t-test.\nYou can see that on the left of the vertical line that indicates the critical mean difference there is a blue area that is part of the alternative model. This is the Type 2 error rate (or 1 - the power of the study). If a study has 80% power, 80% of the mean differences we will observe should fall on the right of the critical value indicated by the line. If the alternative model is true, but we observe an effect smaller than the critical value, the observed p-value will be larger than 0.05, even when there is a true effect. You can check in the app that the larger the effect size, the further to the right the entire alternative distribution falls, and thus the higher the power. You can also see that the larger the sample size, the narrower the distribution, and the less of the distribution will fall below the critical value (as long as the true population mean is larger than the critical value). Finally, the larger the alpha level, the further to the left the critical mean difference moves, and the smaller the area of the alternative distribution that falls below the critical value.\nThe app also plots 3 graphs that illustrate the power curves as a function of different alpha levels, sample sizes, or true mean differences. Play around in the app by changing the values. Get a feel for how each variable impacts the null and alternative models, the mean difference that will be statistically significant, and the Type 1 and Type 2 error rates.\nOpen the app, and make sure it is set to the default settings of a sample size of 50 and an alpha level of 0.05. Look at the distribution of the null model. Set the sample size to 2. Set the sample size to 5000. The app will not allow you to plot data for a ‘group’ size of 1, but with n = 2 you will get a pretty good idea of the range of values you can expect when the true effect is 0, and when you collect single observations (n = 1). Given your experiences with the app as you change different parameters, which statement is true?\n\n\nWhen the null hypothesis is true and the standard deviation is 1, if you randomly take 1 observation from each group and calculate the difference score, the differences will fall between -0.4 and 0.4 for 95% of the pairs of observations you will draw.When the null hypothesis is true and the standard deviation is 1, with n = 50 per group, 95% of studies where data is collected will observe in the long run a mean difference between -0.4 and 0.4.In any study with n = 50 per group, even when the SD is unknown and it is not known if the null hypothesis is true, you should rarely observe a mean difference more extreme than -0.4 or 0.4.As the sample size increases, the expected distribution of means become narrower for the null model, but not for the alternative model.\n\n\nQ4: Open the app once more with the default settings. Set the slider for the alpha level to 0.01 (while keeping the mean difference at 0.5 and the sample size at 50). Compared to the critical value when alpha = 0.05, which statement is true?\n\n\nCompared to an alpha of 0.05, only less extreme values are considered surprising when an alpha of 0.01 is used, and only differences larger than 0.53 scale points (or smaller than -0.53) will now be statistically significant.Compared to an alpha of 0.05, only less extreme values are considered surprising when an alpha of 0.01 is used, and only differences larger than 0.33 scale points (or smaller than -0.33) will now be statistically significant.Compared to an alpha of 0.05, only more extreme values are considered surprising when an alpha of 0.01 is used, and only differences larger than 0.53 scale points (or smaller than -0.53) will be statistically significant.Compared to an alpha of 0.05, only more extreme values are considered surprising when an alpha of 0.01 is used, and only differences larger than 0.33 scale points (or smaller than -0.33) will now be statistically significant.\n\n\nQ5: Why can’t you conclude that the null hypothesis is true, when you observe a statistically non-significant p-value (p &gt; alpha)?\n\n\nWhen calculating p-values you always need to take the prior probability into account.You need to acknowledge the probability that you have observed a Type 1 error.The alternative hypothesis is never true.You need to acknowledge the probability that you have observed a Type 2 error.\n\n\n\nWhen calculating p-values you always need to take the prior probability into account.\nYou need to acknowledge the probability that you have observed a Type 1 error.\nThe null hypothesis is never true.\nYou need to acknowledge the probability that you have observed a Type 2 error.\n\nQ6: Why can’t you conclude that the alternative hypothesis is true, when you observe a statistically significant p-value (p &lt; alpha)?\n\n\nWhen calculating p-values you always need to take the prior probability into account.You need to acknowledge the probability that you have observed a Type 1 error.The alternative hypothesis is never true.You need to acknowledge the probability that you have observed a Type 2 error.\n\n\nQ7: A common concern when interpreting p-values is that ‘significant’ in normal language implies ‘important’, and thus a ‘significant’ effect is interpreted as an ‘important’ effect. However, the question whether an effect is important is completely orthogonal to the question whether it is different from zero, or even how large the effect is. Not all effects have practical impact. The smaller the effect, the less likely such effects will be noticed by individuals, but such effects might still have a large impact on a societal level. Therefore, the general take home message is that statistical significance does not answer the question whether an effect matters in practice, or is ‘practically important’. To answer the question whether an effect matters, you need to present a cost-benefit analysis.\nGo to the app: http://shiny.ieis.tue.nl/d_p_power/. Set the sample size to 50000, the mean difference to 0.5, and the alpha level to 0.05. Which effects will, when observed, be statistically different from 0?\n\n\nEffects more extreme than -0.01 and 0.01ffects more extreme than -0.04 and 0.04Effects more extreme than -0.05 and 0.05Effects more extreme than -0.12 and 0.12\n\n\nIf we plot the null model for a very large sample size (e.g., n = 10000 per group) we see that even very small mean differences (differences more extreme than a mean difference of 0.04) will be considered ‘surprising’. This still means that if there really is no difference in the population, you will observe differences larger than 0.04 less than 5% of the time, in the long run, and 95% of the observed differences will be smaller than a mean difference of 0.04. But it becomes more difficult to argue for the practical significance of such effects. Imagine that a specific intervention is successful in changing people’s spending behavior, and when implementing some intervention people save 12 cents per year. It is difficult to argue how this effect will make any individual happier. However, if this money is combined, it will yield over 2 million, which could be used to treat diseases in developing countries, where it would have a real impact. The cost of the intervention might be considered too high if the goal is to make individuals happier, but it might be consider worthwhile if the goal is to raise 2 million for charity.\nNot all effects in psychology are additive (we cannot combine or transfer an increase in happiness of 0.04 scale points), so it is often more difficult to argue for the importance of small effects in subjective feelings. A cost-benefit analysis might show small effects matter a lot, but whether or not this is the case cannot be inferred from a p-value. Instead, you need to report and interpret the effect size,\nQ8: Let’s assume that the random number generator in R works, and we use rnorm(n = 50, mean = 0, sd = 1) to generate 50 observations, and the mean of these observations is 0.5, which in a one-sample t-test against an effect of 0 yields a p-value of 0.03, which is smaller than the alpha level (which we have set to 0.05). What is the probability that we have observed a significant difference (p &lt; alpha) just by chance?\n\n\n3%5%95%100%\n\n\nQ9: Which statement is true?\n\n\nThe probability that a replication study will yield a significant result is 1-p.The probability that a replication study will yield a significant result is 1-p multiplied by the probability that the null hypothesis is true.The probability that a replication study will yield a significant result is equal to the statistical power of the replication study (if there is a true effect), or the alpha level (if there is no true effect).The probability that a replication study will yield a significant result is equal to the statistical power of the replication study + the alpha level.\n\n\nThis question is conceptually very similar to that asked by Tversky and Kahneman (1971) in article ‘Belief in the law of small numbers’:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.13: Screenshot of first paragraph in Tversky and Kahneman, 1971.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose you have run an experiment on 20 subjects, and have obtained a significant result which confirms your theory (z = 2.23, p &lt; .05, two-tailed). You now have cause to run an additional group of 10 subjects. What do you think the probability is that the results will be significant, by a one-tailed test, separately for this group?\n\nTversky and Kahneman argue a reasonable answer is 48%, but the only correct response is the same as the correct response to question 9, and the exact probability cannot be known (Miller, 2009).\nQ10: Does a non-significant p-value (i.e., p = 0.65) mean that the null hypothesis is true?\n\n\nNo - the result could be a Type 2 error, or a false negative.Yes, because it is a true negative.Yes, if the p-value is larger than the alpha level the null hypothesis is true.No, because you need at least two non-significant p-values to conclude the null hypothesis is true.\n\n\nQ11: What is a correct way to present a non-significant p-value (e.g., p = 0.34 assuming an alpha level of 0.05 is used in an independent t-test)?\n\n\nThe null hypothesis was confirmed, p &gt; 0.05There was no difference between the two conditions, p &gt; 0.05The observed difference was not statistically different from 0.The null hypothesis is true.\n\n\nQ12: Does observing a significant p-value (p &lt; .05) mean that the null hypothesis is false?\n\n\nNo, because p &lt; .05 only means that the alternative is true, not that the null hypothesis is wrong.No, because p-values are never a statement about the probability of a hypothesis or theory.Yes, because an exceptionally rare event has occurred.Yes, because the difference is statistically significant.\n\n\nQ13: Is a statistically significant effect always a practically important effect?\n\n\nNo, because in extremely large samples, extremely small effects can be statistically significant, and small effects are never practically important.No, because the alpha level could in theory be set to 0.20, and in that case a significant effect is not practically important.No, because how important an effect is depends on a cost-benefit analysis, not on how surprising the data is under the null hypothesis.All of the above are true.\n\n\nQ14: What is the correct definition of a p-value?\n\n\nA p-value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true, given data that is as extreme or more extreme than the data you have observed. A p-value is the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true, given data that is as extreme or more extreme than the data you have observed.A p-value is the probability of observing data that is as extreme or more extreme than the data you have observed, assuming the alternative hypothesis is true.A p-value is the probability of observing data that is as extreme or more extreme than the data you have observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. \n\n\n\n1.8.3 Open Questions\n\nWhat determines the shape of the p-value distribution?\nHow does the shape of the p-value distribution change when there is a true effect and the sample size increases?\nWhat is Lindley’s paradox?\nHow are p-values distributed when there is no true effect?\nWhat is the correct definition of a p-value?\nWhy is it incorrect to think that a non-significant p-value means that the null hypothesis is true?\nWhy is it incorrect to think that a significant p-value means that the null hypothesis is false?\nWhy is it incorrect to think that a significant p-value means that a practically important effect has been discovered?\nWhy is it incorrect to think that if you have observed a significant finding, the probability that you have made a Type 1 error (a false positive) is 5%?\nWhy is it incorrect to think that 1 – p (e.g., 1 – 0.05 = 0.95) is the probability that the effect will replicate when repeated?\n\n\n\n\n\nAnvari, F., Kievit, R., Lakens, D., Pennington, C.

    "text": "2.1 Which outcome can you expect if you perform a study?\nIf you perform a study and plan to make a claim based on the statistical test you plan to perform, the long run probability of making a correct claim or an erroneous claim is determined by three factors, namely the Type 1 error rate, the Type 2 error rate, and the probability that the null hypothesis is true. There are four possible outcomes of a statistical test, depending on whether the result is statistically significant or not, and whether the null hypothesis is true, or not.\nFalse Positive (FP): Concluding there is a true effect, when there is a no true effect (\\(H_0\\) is true). This is also referred to as a Type 1 error, and indicated by \\(\\alpha\\).\nFalse Negative (FN): Concluding there is a no true effect, when there is a true effect (\\(H_1\\) is true). This is also referred to as a Type 2 error, and indicated by \\(\\beta\\).\nTrue Negative (TN): Concluding there is no true effect, when there is no true effect (\\(H_0\\) is true). This is the complement of False Positives, and is thus indicated by 1-\\(\\alpha\\).\nTrue Positive (TP): Concluding there is a true effect, when there is a true effect (\\(H_1\\) is true). This is the complement of False Negatives, and is thus indicated by 1-\\(\\beta\\).\nThe probability of observing a true positive when there is a true effect is, in the long run, equal to the statistical power of your study. The probability of observing a false positive when the null hypothesis is true is, in the long run, equal to the alpha level you have set, or the Type 1 error rate.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Difference between Type 1 and Type 2 errors. Figure made by Paul Ellis\n\n\n\n\nSo, for the next study you will perform, which of the four possible outcomes is most likely? First, let’s assume you have set the alpha level to 5%. Furthermore, let’s assume you have designed a study so that it will have 80% power (and for this example, let’s assume Omniscient Jones knows you indeed have exactly 80% power). The last thing to specify is the probability that the null hypothesis is true. Let’s assume for this next study you have no idea if the null hypothesis is true or not, and that it is equally likely that the null hypothesis is true, or the alternative hypothesis is true (both have a probability of 50%). We can now calculate what the most likely outcome of such a study is.\nBefore we perform this calculation, take a moment to think if you know the answer. You might have designed studies with a 5% alpha level and 80% power, where you believed it was equally likely that \\(H_0\\) or \\(H_1\\) was true. Surely, it is useful to have reasonable expectations about which result to expect, when we perform such a study? Yet in my experience, many researchers perform without thinking about these probabilities at all. They often hope to observe a true positive, even when in the situation described above, the most likely outcome is a true negative. Let’s now calculate these probabilities.\nLet’s assume we perform 200 studies with a 5% alpha level, 80% power, and a 50% probability that \\(H_0\\) is true. How many false positives, true positives, false negatives, and true negatives should we expect in the long run?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(H_0\\) True (50%)\n\n\\(H_1\\) True (50%)\n\n\n\nSignificant Finding (Positive result) \\(\\alpha\\) = 5%, 1-\\(\\beta\\) = 80%\nFalse Positive 5% \\(\\times\\) 50% = 2.5% (5 studies)\nTrue Positive 80% \\(\\times\\) 50% = 40% (80 studies)\n\n\nNon-Significant Finding (Negative result) 1-\\(\\alpha\\) = 95%, \\(\\beta\\) = 20%\nTrue Negative 95% \\(\\times\\) 50% = 47.5% (95 studies)\nFalse Negative 20% \\(\\times\\) 50% = 10% (20 studies)\n\n\n\nIn the table above we see that 2.5% of all studies will be a false positive (a 5% Type 1 error rate, multiplied by a 50% probability that \\(H_0\\) is true). 40% of all studies will be a true positive (80% power multiplied by a 50% probability that \\(H_1\\) is true). The probability of a false negative is 10% (a 20% Type 2 error rate multiplied by a 50% probability that \\(H_1\\) is true). The most likely outcome is a true negative, with 47.5% (a 95% probability observing a non-significant result, multiplied by a 50% probability that \\(H_0\\) is true).\nIt might be that you are not too enthusiastic about this outlook, and you would like to perform studies that have a higher probability of observing a true positive. What should we do? We can reduce the alpha level, increase the power, or increase the probability that \\(H_1\\) is true. As the probability of observing a true positive depends on the power, multiplied by the probability that \\(H_1\\) is true, we should design studies where both of these values are high. Statistical power can be increased by changes in the design of the study (e.g., by increasing the sample size). The probability that \\(H_1\\) is true depends on the hypothesis you are testing. If the probability that \\(H_1\\) is true is very high from the outset, you are at the risk of testing a hypothesis that is already established with enough certainty. A solution, which might not happen that often in your career, is to come up with the test of a hypothesis that is not trivial, but that after explaining it to peers makes a lot of sense. In other words, they would not have come up with the idea themselves, but after explaining it to them, they think it is extremely plausible. Such creative research ideas will most likely be very rare in your academic career, if you ever have any at all. Not all research needs to be this ground-breaking. It is also extremely valuable to perform replication and extension studies where it is relatively likely that \\(H_1\\) is true, but the scientific community still benefits from knowing that findings generalize to different circumstances."

    "section": "\n2.2 Positive predictive value",
    "text": "2.2 Positive predictive value\nJohn Ioannidis wrote a well known article titled “Why Most Published Research Findings Are False” (Ioannidis, 2005). At the same time, we have learned that if you set your alpha at 5%, the Type 1 error rate will not be higher than 5% (in the long run). How are these two statements related? Why aren’t 95% of published research findings true? The key to understanding this difference is that two different probabilities are calculated. The Type 1 error rate is the probability of saying there is an effect, when there is no effect. Ioannidis calculates the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the conditional probability that if a study turns out to show a statistically significant result, there is actually a true effect. This probability is useful to understand, because people often selectively focus on significant results, and because due to publication bias, in some research areas only significant results are published.\nA real-life example where it was useful to understand the concept of the positive predictive value concerned the number of vaccinated and unvaccinated people admitted to hospital with COVID symptoms. In some places, equal numbers of patients were vaccinated as unvaccinated. If you do not understand the concept of a positive predictive value, you might believe this reveals that it is equally likely to end up in the hospital, whether you are vaccinated or not. This is incorrect. As Figure 2.2 nicely visualizes, the probability that a person is vaccinated is very high, and the probability that a vaccinated person ends up in the hospital is much lower than the probability that an unvaccinated person ends up in the hospital. However, if we select only those individuals who end up in the hospital, we are computing a probability conditional on being in the hospital.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: The positive predictive value can be used to explain why there are more vaccinated people in the hospital than unvaccinated people.\n\n\n\n\nIt is useful to understand what the probability is that, if you have observed a significant result in an experiment, the result is actually a true positive. In other words, in the long run, how many true positives can we expect, among all positive results (both true positives and false positives)? This is known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). We can also calculate how many false positives we can expect, among all positive results (again, both true positives and false positives). This is known as the False Positive Report Probability (Wacholder et al., 2004), sometimes also referred to as the False Positive Risk (Colquhoun, 2019).\n\\[PPV = \\frac{\\text{True}\\ \\text{Positives}}{(\\text{True}\\ \\text{Positives} +\n                                                \\text{False}\\ \\text{Positives})}\\]\n\\[FPRP = \\frac{\\text{False}\\ \\text{Positives}}{(\\text{True}\\ \\text{Positives}\n                                                  + \\text{False}\\ \\text{Positives})}\\]\nThe PPV and FPRP combine classic Frequentist concepts of statistical power and alpha levels with prior probabilities that \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) are true. They depend on the proportion of studies you do where there is an effect (\\(H_1\\) is true), and where there is no effect (\\(H_0\\) is true), in addition to the statistical power, and the alpha level. After all, you can only observe a false positive if the null hypothesis is true, and you can only observe a true positive if the alternative hypothesis is true. Whenever you perform a study, you are either operating in a reality where there is a true effect, or you are operating in a reality where there is no effect – but you don’t know in which reality you are.\nWhen you perform studies, you will be aware of all outcomes of your studies (both the significant and the non-significant findings). When you read the literature, there is publication bias, and you often only have access to significant results. This is when thinking about the PPV (and the FPRP) becomes important. If we set the alpha level to 5%, in the long run 5% of studies where \\(H_0\\) is true (FP + TN) will be significant. But in a literature with only significant results, we do not have access to all true negatives, and it is possible that the proportion of false positives in the literature is much larger than 5%.\nIf we continue the example above, we see there are 85 positive results (80 + 5) in the 200 studies. The false positive report probability is 5/85 = 0.0588. At the same time, the alpha of 5% guarantees that (in the long run) 5% of the 100 studies where the null hypothesis is true are Type 1 errors: 5%*100 = 5. This is also true. When we do 200 studies, at most 0.05*200 = 10 could possibly be false positives (if \\(H_0\\) was true in all experiments). In the 200 studies we performed (and where \\(H_0\\) was true in only 50% of the studies), the proportion of false positives for all experiments is only 2.5%. Thus, for all experiments you do, the proportion of false positives will, in the long run, never be higher than the Type I error rate set by the researcher (e.g., 5% when \\(H_0\\) is true in all experiments), but it can be lower (when \\(H_0\\) is true in less than 100% of the experiments).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Screenshot of the output of the results of the PPV Shiny app by Michael Zehetleitner and Felix Schönbrodt \n\n\n\n\n(Note: The FDR and FPRP are different abbreviations for the same thing.)\nPeople often say something like: “Well, we all know 1 in 20 results in the published literature are Type 1 errors”. You should be able to understand this is not true in practice, after learning about the positive predictive value. When in 100% of the studies you perform, the null hypothesis is true, and all studies are published, only then are 1 in 20 studies, in the long run, false positives (and the rest correctly reveal no statistically significant difference). It also explains why the common p-value misconception “If you have observed a significant finding, the probability that you have made a Type 1 error (a false positive) is 5%.” is not correct, because in practice the null hypothesis is not true in all tests that are performed (sometimes the alternative hypothesis is true). Importantly, as long as there is publication bias (where findings with desired results end up in the scientific literature, and for example non-significant results are not shared) then even if researchers use a 5% alpha level, it is quite reasonable to assume much more than 5% of significant findings in the published literature are false positives. In the scientific literature, the false positive report probability can be quite high, and under specific circumstances, it might even be so high that most published research findings are false. This will happen when researchers examine mostly studies where the null hypothesis is true, with low power, or when the Type 1 error rate is inflated due to p-hacking or other types of bias."

    "text": "2.3 Type 1 error inflation\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Quote from the 1830 book by Babbage Reflections on the Decline of Science in England And on Some of Its Causes.\n\n\n\n\nIf you perform multiple comparisons, there is a risk that the Type 1 error rate inflates. When multiple comparisons are planned, in some cases it is possible to control the Type 1 error rate by lowering the alpha level for each individual analysis. The most widely known approach to control for multiple comparisons is the Bonferroni correction where the alpha level is divided by the number of tests that is performed (Dunn, 1961). However, researchers also often use informal data analysis strategies that inflate the Type 1 error rate. Babbage (1830) already complained about these problematic practices in 1830, and two centuries later, they are still common. Barber (1976) provides an in depth discussion of a range of approaches, such as eyeballing the data to decide which hypotheses to test (sometimes called ‘double dipping’), selectively reporting only those analyses that confirm predictions, and ignoring non-significant results, collecting many variables and performing multitudes of tests, or performing sub-group analyses when the planned analysis yields nonsignificant results, or after a nonsignificant prediction derive a new hypothesis that is supported by the data, and test the hypothesis on the data that the hypothesis was derived from (sometimes called HARKing, Hypothesizing After Results Are Known (Kerr, 1998)). Many researchers admit to having used practices that inflate error rates (see section about questionable research practices in the chapter on research integrity). I myself have used such practices in the first scientific article I published, before I was fully aware of how problematic this was - for an article we published several years later in which we reflect on this, see Jostmann et al. (2016).\nFor some paradigms, researchers have a lot of flexibility in how to compute the main dependent variable. Elson and colleagues examined 130 publications that use the Competitive Reaction Time Task, in which participants select the duration and intensity of blasts to be delivered to a competitor (Elson et al., 2014). The task is used to measure ‘aggressive behavior’ in an ethical manner. To compute the score, researchers can use the duration of a noise blast, the intensity, or a combination thereof, averaged over any number of trials, with several possible transformations of the data. The 130 publications that were examined reported 157 different quantification strategies in total, showing that most calculations of the dependent variable were unique, used only in a single article. One might wonder why the same authors sometimes used different computations across articles. One possible explanation is that they used this flexibility in the data analysis to find statistically significant results.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Plot of publications using CRTT (blue) and unique quantifications of the measure (red).

    "text": "2.4 Optional stopping\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Screenshot a scientific paper explicitly admitting to using optional stopping.\n\n\n\n\nOne practice that inflates the Type 1 error rate is known as optional stopping. In optional stopping, a researcher repeatedly analyzes the data, continues the data collection when the test result is not statistically significant, but stops when a significant effect is observed. The quote from a published article in the figure above is an example where researchers transparently report they used optional stopping, but more commonly people do not disclose the use of optional stopping in their methods sections. In recent years, many researchers have learned that optional stopping is problematic. This has lead some to the general idea that you should not collect data, look at whether the results are significant, and stop data collection when the result is significant, or if not, continue data collection. That is not the correct conclusion, and is an example of becoming too inflexible. The correct approach - to collect data in batches, called sequential analysis - has been extensively developed by statisticians, and is used in many medical trials. We will discuss sequential analyses in a dedicated chapter. The main lesson is that certain research practices can increase the flexibility and efficiency of studies you perform, when done right, but the same practices can inflate the Type 1 error rate when done wrong. Let’s therefore try to get a better understanding when we are inflating our Type 1 error rate with optional stopping, and how to do this correctly using sequential analysis.\nCopy the code below into R and run it. This script will simulate an ongoing data collection. After 10 participants in each condition, a p-value is calculated by performing an independent t-test, and this t-test is then repeated after every additional participant that is collected. Then, all these p-values are plotted as a function of the increasing sample size.\n\nn &lt;- 200 # total number of datapoints (per condition) after initial 10\nd &lt;- 0.0 # effect size d\n\np &lt;- numeric(n) # store p-values\nx &lt;- numeric(n) # store x-values\ny &lt;- numeric(n) # store y-values\n\nn &lt;- n + 10 # add 10 to number of datapoints\n\nfor (i in 10:n) { # for each simulated participants after the first 10\n  x[i] &lt;- rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n  y[i] &lt;- rnorm(n = 1, mean = d, sd = 1)\n  p[i] &lt;- t.test(x[1:i], y[1:i], var.equal = TRUE)$p.value\n}\n\np &lt;- p[10:n] # Remove first 10 empty p-values\n\n# Create the plot\npar(bg = \"#fffafa\")\nplot(0, col = \"red\", lty = 1, lwd = 3, ylim = c(0, 1), xlim = c(10, n), \n     type = \"l\", xlab = \"sample size\", ylab = \"p-value\")\nlines(p, lwd = 2)\nabline(h = 0.05, col = \"darkgrey\", lty = 2, lwd = 2) # draw line at p = 0.05\n\nmin(p) # Return lowest p-value from all looks\ncat(\"The lowest p-value was observed at sample size\", which.min(p) + 10) \ncat(\"The p-value dropped below 0.05 for the first time at sample size:\", \n    ifelse(is.na(which(p &lt; 0.05)[1] + 10), \"NEVER\", which(p &lt; 0.05)[1] + 10)) \n\nFor example, in the Figure below, you see the p-value plotted on the y-axis (from 0 to 1) and the sample size plotted on the x-axis (from 0 to 200). For this simulation, the true effect size was d = 0, meaning there is no true effect. We can thus only observe true negatives or false positives. As the sample size increases, the p-value slowly moves up and down (remember from the chapter on p-values that when there is no true effect, p-values are uniformly distributed). In Figure 2.7), the p-value drops below the grey line (indicating an alpha level 0.05) after collecting 83 participants in each condition, only to drift back upwards to larger p-values. From this figure, it becomes clear that the more often we look at the data, and the larger the total sample size, the higher the probability that one of the analyses will yield a p &lt; \\(\\alpha\\). If resources are infinite, the Type 1 error rate will be 1, and a researcher can always find a significant result through optional stopping.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Simulated p-values for each additional observation when the null is true.\n\n\n\n\nWhen there is a true effect, we see that p-values also vary, but they will eventually drop to below the alpha level. Due to the variation, we just do not know exactly when. When we perform an a-priori power analysis, we can compute the probability that looking at a specific sample size will yield a significant p-value. In Figure 2.8 we see the same simulation, but now when there is a true but small effect of d = 0.3. With 200 observations per condition, a sensitivity power analysis reveals that we have 85% power. If we would analyze the data at an interim analysis (e.g., after 150 observations) we would often already find a statistically significant effect (as we would have 74% power). This illustrates a benefit of sequential analyses, where we control error rates, but can stop early at an interim analysis. Sequential analyses are especially useful in large or expensive studies where there is uncertainty about the true effect size.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Simulated p-values for each additional observation when d = 0.3.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s more formally examine the inflation of the Type 1 error rate through optional stopping in a simulation study.

In the first four lines, you can set the most important parameters of the simulation. First, the maximum sample size in each condition (e.g., 100). Then, the number of looks (e.g., 5). At best, you can look at the data after every participant (e.g., with 100 participants, you can look 100 times – or actually 98 times, because you need more than 2 participants in each condition for a t-test!). You can set the number of simulations (the more, the clearer the pattern will be, but the longer the simulation takes), and the alpha level (e.g., 0.05). Since you can only make a Type 1 error when there is no true effect, the effect size is set to 0 in these simulations.\nWhen you perform only a single test, the Type 1 error rate is the probability of finding a p-value lower than your alpha level, when there is no effect. In an optional stopping scenario where you look at the data twice, the Type 1 error rate is the probability of finding a p-value lower than your alpha level at the first look, and the probability of not finding a p-value lower than your alpha level at the first look, but finding a p-value lower than your alpha level at the second look. This is a conditional probability, which makes error control a little bit more complex than when multiple looks are completely independent.\nSo how much does optional stopping inflate the Type 1 error rate? And which p-values can we expect under optional stopping?\nStart by running the simulation without changing any values, so simulating 100 participants in each condition, looking 5 times at your data, with an alpha of 0.05. Note the 50.000 simulations take a while! You should see something similar to Figure 2.9 below (which is based on 500.000 simulations to make the pattern very clear).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Simulation of 500000 studies performing 5 interim analyses at an alpha level of 5%.\n\n\n\n\nWe see 100 bars, one for each % (so one for all p-values between 0.00 and 0.01, one for p-values between 0.01 and 0.02, etc.). There is a horizontal line that indicates where all p-values should fall, if they would be uniformly distributed (as they should be when there is no true effect, as explained in the chapter on p-values).\nThe distribution of p-values is peculiar. We see that compared to a uniform distributions, a bunch of results just above the alpha threshold of 0.05 are missing, and they seem to have been pulled just below 0.05, where there is a much higher frequency of outcomes compared to when data is not analyzed multiple times as it comes in. Notice how relatively high p-values (e.g., p = 0.04) are more common than lower p-values (e.g., 0.01). We will see in the chapter on bias detection that statistical techniques such as p-curve analysis can pick up on this pattern.\nWhen using an alpha level of 5% with 5 looks at the data, the overall Type 1 error rate has inflated to 14%. If we lower the alpha level at each interim analysis, the overall Type 1 error rate can be controlled. The shape of the p-value distribution will still look peculiar, but the total number of significant test results will be controlled at the desired alpha level. The well-known Bonferroni correction (i.e., using an alpha level of \\(\\alpha\\) / the number of looks), but the Pocock correction is slightly more efficient. For more information on how to perform interim analyses while controlling error rates, see the dedicated chapter on sequential analysis."

    "text": "2.5 Justifying Error Rates\n\nIf we reject \\(H_0\\) , we may reject it when it is true; if we accept \\(H_0\\) , we may be accepting it when it is false, that is to say, when really some alternative Bt is true. These two sources of error can rarely be eliminated completely; in some cases it will be more important to avoid the first, in others the second. We are reminded of the old problem considered by Laplace of the number of votes in a court of judges that should be needed to convict a prisoner. Is it more serious to convict an innocent man or to acquit a guilty? That will depend upon the consequences of the error; whether the punishment is death or a fine; what the danger is to the community of released criminals; and what are the current ethical views on punishment. From the point of view of mathematical theory, all that we can do is to show how the risk of the errors may be controlled and minimised. The use of these statistical tools in any given case, in determining just how the balance should be struck, must be left to the investigator.\n\nEven though in theory the Type 1 and Type 2 error rate should be justified by the researcher (as Neyman and Pearson (1933) write above), in practice researchers tend to imitate others. The default use of an alpha level of 0.05 can already be found in the work of Gosset on the t-distribution (Cowles & Davis, 1982; Kennedy-Shaffer, 2019), who believed that a difference of two standard deviations (a z-score of 2) was sufficiently rare. The default use of 80% power (or a 20% Type 2 error rate) is similarly based on personal preferences by Cohen (1988), who writes:\n\nIt is proposed here as a convention that, when the investigator has no other basis for setting the desired power value, the value .80 be used. This means that beta is set at .20. This value is offered for several reasons (Cohen, 1965, pp. 98-99). The chief among them takes into consideration the implicit convention for alpha of .05. The beta of .20 is chosen with the idea that the general relative seriousness of these two kinds of errors is of the order of .20/.05, i.e., that Type I errors are of the order of four times as serious as Type II errors. This .80 desired power convention is offered with the hope that it will be ignored whenever an investigator can find a basis in his substantive concerns about his specific research investigation to choose a value ad hoc.\n\nWe see that conventions are built on conventions: the norm to aim for 80% power is built on the norm to set the alpha level at 5%. Although there is nothing special about an alpha level of 5%, it is interesting to reflect on why it has become so widely established. Irwin Bross (1971) argues the use of an alpha level is functional and efficient when seen as an aspect of communication networks among scientists, and writes “Thus the specification of the critical levels […] has proved in practice to be an effective method for controlling the noise in communication networks.” Bross believes the 0.05 threshold is somewhat, but not completely arbitrary, and asks us to imagine what would have happened had an alpha level of 0.001 been proposed, or an alpha level of 0.20. In both cases, he believes the convention would not have spread – in the first case because in many fields there are not sufficient resources to make claims at such a low error rate, and in the second case because few researchers would have found that alpha level a satisfactory quantification of ‘rare’ events. Uygun Tunç et al. (2021) argue that one possible reason is that, as far as conventions go, an alpha level of 5% might be low enough such that peers take any claims made with this error rate seriously, while at the same time being high enough such that peers will be motivated to perform an independent replication study to increase or decrease our confidence in the claim. Although lower error rates would establish claims more convincingly, this would also require more resources. One might speculate that in research areas where not every claim is important enough to a careful justification of costs and benefits, 5% has a pragmatic function in facilitating conjectures and refutations in fields that otherwise lack a coordinated approach to knowledge generation, but are faced with limited resources.\nNevertheless, some researchers have proposed to move away from the default use of a 5% alpha level. For example, Johnson (2013) proposes a default significance level of 0.005 or 0.001. Others have cautioned against such blanket recommendation because the additional resources required to reduce the Type 1 error rate might not be worth the costs (Lakens et al., 2018). A lower alpha lever requires a larger sample size to achieve the same statistical power. If the sample size cannot be increased, a lower alpha level reduces the statistical power, and increases the Type 2 error rate. Whether that is desirable should be evaluated on a case by case basis.\nThere are two main reasons to abandon the universal use of a 5% alpha level. The first reason to carefully choose an alpha level is that decision-making becomes more efficient (Gannon et al., 2019; Mudge et al., 2012). If researchers use hypothesis tests to make dichotomous decisions from a methodological falsificationist approach to statistical inferences, and have a certain maximum sample size they are willing or able to collect, it is typically possible to make decisions more efficiently by choosing error rates such that the combined cost of Type 1 and Type 2 errors is minimized. If we aim to either minimize or balance Type 1 and Type 2 error rates for a given sample size and effect size, the alpha level should be set not based on convention, but by weighting the relative cost of both types of errors (Maier & Lakens, 2022).\nFor example, imagine a researcher plans to collect 64 participants per condition to detect a d = 0.5 effect, and weighs the cost of Type 1 errors 4 times as much as Type 2 errors. This is exactly the scenario Cohen (1988) described, and with 64 participants per condition the relative weight of Type 1 and Type 2 errors yields a 5% Type 1 error rate and a 20% Type 2 error rate. Now imagine this researcher realizes they have the resources to collect 80 observations instead of just 64. With an interest in an effect size of d = 0.5, the relative weight of Type 1 and Type 2 errors of 4 would be satisfied when they set the alpha level to 0.037 as then the Type 2 error rate is 0.147. Alternatively, the researcher might have decided to collect 64 observations, but not balance the error rates, but set the alpha level such that the weighted combined error rate is minimized, which is achieved when the alpha level is set to 0.033, as visualized in Figure 2.10 (for further information, see Maier & Lakens (2022)).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Weighted combined error rate, minimized at alpha = 0.037.\n\n\n\n\nJustifying error rates can lead to situations where the alpha level is increased above 0.05, because this leads to more optimal decision making. Winer (1962) writes:\n\nThe frequent use of the .05 and .01 levels of significance is a matter of convention having little scientific or logical basis. When the power of tests is likely to be low under these levels of significance, and when Type 1 and Type 2 errors are of approximately equal importance, the .30 and .20 levels of significance may be more appropriate than the .05 and .01 levels.”\n\nThe reasoning here is that a design that has 70% power for the smallest effect size of interest would not balance the Type 1 and Type 2 error rates in a sensible manner. Of course, such an increase of the alpha level should only be deemed acceptable when authors can justify that the costs of the increase in the Type 1 error rate is sufficiently compensated by the benefit of decreased Type 2 error rate. This will encompass cases where (1) the study will have practical implications that require decision making, (2) a cost-benefit analysis is provided that gives a clear rationale for relatively high costs of a Type 2 error, (3) the probability that \\(H_1\\) is false is relatively low, and (4) it is not feasible to reduce overall error rates by collecting more data.\nOne should also carefully reflect on the choice of the alpha level when an experiment achieves very high statistical power for all effect sizes that are considered meaningful. If a study has 99% power for effect sizes of interest, and thus a 1% Type 2 error rate, but uses the default 5% alpha level, it also suffers from a lack of balance, and the use of a lower alpha level would lead to a more balanced decision, and increase the severity of the test.\nThe second reason is most relevant for large data sets, and is related to Lindley’s paradox. As the statistical power increases, some p-values below 0.05 (e.g., p = 0.04) can be more likely when there is no effect than when there is an effect. To prevent situations where a frequentist rejects the null hypothesis based on p &lt; 0.05, when the evidence in the test favors the null hypothesis over the alternative hypothesis, it is recommended to lower the alpha level as a function of the sample size. The need to do so is discussed by Leamer (1978), who writes “The rule of thumb quite popular now, that is, setting the significance level arbitrarily to .05, is shown to be deficient in the sense that from every reasonable viewpoint the significance level should be a decreasing function of sample size.” The idea of this approach is to reduce the alpha level such that a Bayes factor or likelihood computed for a significant result would never be evidence for the null hypothesis (for an online Shiny app to perform such calculations, see here."

    "text": "2.6 Why you don’t need to adjust your alpha level for all tests you’ll do in your lifetime.\nSome researchers criticize corrections for multiple comparisons because one might as well correct for all tests you do in your lifetime (Perneger, 1998). If you choose to use a Neyman-Pearson approach to statistics the only reason to correct for all tests you perform in your lifetime is when all the work you have done in your life tests a single theory, and you would use your last words to decide to accept or reject this theory, as long as only one of all individual tests you have performed yielded a p &lt; \\(\\alpha\\). Researchers rarely work like this.\nInstead, in a Neyman-Pearson approach to hypothesis testing, the goal is to use data to make decisions about how to act. Neyman (1957) calls his approach inductive behavior. The outcome of an experiment leads one to take different possible actions, which can be either practical (e.g., implement a new procedure, abandon a research line) or scientific (e.g., claim there is or is no effect). From an error-statistical approach (Mayo, 2018) inflated Type 1 error rates mean that it has become very likely that you will be able to claim support for your hypothesis, even when the hypothesis is wrong. This reduces the severity of the test. To prevent this, we need to control our error rate at the level of our claim.\nA useful distinction in the literature on multiple testing is a union-intersection testing approach, and an intersection-union testing approach (Dmitrienko & D’Agostino Sr, 2013). In a union-intersection approach, a claim is made when at-least-one test is significant. In these cases, a correction for multiple comparisons is required to control the error rate. In an intersection-union approach, a claim is made when all performed tests are statistically significant, and no correction for multiple comparisons is required (and indeed, under some assumptions researchers could even increase the alpha level in a intersection-union approach).\nLet’s assume we collect data from 100 participants in a control and treatment condition. We collect 3 dependent variables (dv1, dv2, and dv3). In the population there is no difference between groups on any of these three variables (the true effect size is 0). We will analyze the three dv’s in independent t-tests. This requires specifying our alpha level, and thus deciding whether we need to correct for multiple comparisons. For some reason I do not fully understand, several researchers believe it is difficult to decide when you need to correct for multiple comparisons. As Bretz, Hothorn, & Westfall (2011) write in their excellent book “Multiple Comparisons Using R”: “The appropriate choice of null hypotheses being of primary interest is a controversial question. That is, it is not always clear which set of hypotheses should constitute the family H1,…,Hm. This topic has often been in dispute and there is no general consensus.” In one of the best papers on controlling for multiple comparisons out there, Bender & Lange (2001) write: “Unfortunately, there is no simple and unique answer to when it is appropriate to control which error rate. Different persons may have different but nevertheless reasonable opinions. In addition to the problem of deciding which error rate should be under control, it has to be defined first which tests of a study belong to one experiment.”\nI have never understood this confusion, at least not when working within a Neyman-Pearson approach to hypothesis testing, where the goal is to control error rates at the level of a statistical claim. How we control error rates depends on the claim(s) we want to make. We might want to act as if (or claim that) our treatment works if there is a difference between the treatment and control conditions on any of the three variables. This means we consider the prediction corroborated when the p-value of the first t-test is smaller than alpha level, the p-value of the second t-test is smaller than the alpha level, or the p-value of the third t-test is smaller than the alpha level. This falls under the union-intersection approach, and a researcher should correct the alpha level for multiple comparisons.\nWe could also want to make three different predictions. Instead of one hypothesis (“something will happen”) we have three different hypotheses, and predict there will be an effect on dv1, dv2, and dv3. Each of these claims can be corroborated, or not. As these are three tests, that inform three claims, there are no multiple comparisons, and no correction for the alpha level is required.\nIt might seem if researchers can get out of corrections for multiple comparisons by formulating a hypothesis for every possible test they will perform. Indeed, they can. For a ten by ten correlation matrix, a researcher might state they are testing 45 unique predictions, each at an uncorrected alpha level. However, readers might reasonably question whether these 45 tests were all predicted by a sensible theory, or if the author is just making up predictions in order to not have to correct the alpha level. Distinguishing between these two scenarios is not a statistical question, but a theoretical question. If only a few of the 45 tests corroborate the prediction, the meager track record of the predictions should make readers doubt the body of work that was used to derive the predictions has anything going for it.\nThere are different ways to control for error rates, the easiest being the Bonferroni correction an the ever-so-slightly less conservative Holm-Bonferroni sequential procedure. When the number of statistical tests becomes substantial, it is sometimes preferable to control false discovery rates, instead of error rates (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995)."

    "section": "\n2.7 Power Analysis",
    "text": "2.7 Power Analysis\nSo far we have largely focused on Type 1 error control. As was clear from Figure 2.8, when there is a true effect p-values will eventually become smaller than an alpha level as the sample size becomes large enough. When designing an experiment, one goal might be to choose a sample size that provides a desired Type 2 error rate for an effect size of interest. This can be achieved by performing an a-priori power analysis. The statistical power of a test (and the Type 2 error rate) depends on the effect size, the sample size, and the alpha level. The larger the sample size, effect size, and alpha level, the higher the statistical power, and the lower the effect size, sample size, and alpha level, the lower the statistical power.\nIt is important to highlight that the goal of an a-priori power analysis is not to achieve sufficient power for the true effect size. The true effect size is always unknown when designing a study. The goal of an a-priori power analysis is to achieve sufficient power, given a specific assumption of the effect size a researcher wants to detect. Just like a Type I error rate is the maximum probability of making a Type I error conditional on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, an a-priori power analysis is computed under the assumption of a specific effect size. It is unknown if this assumption is correct. All a researcher can do is to make sure their assumptions are well justified. Statistical inferences based on a test where the Type II error is controlled are conditional on the assumption of a specific effect size. They allow the inference that, assuming the true effect size is at least as large as that used in the a-priori power analysis, the maximum Type II error rate in a study is not larger than a desired value.\nIn Figure 2.11 we see the expected distribution of observed standardized effect sizes (Cohen’s d) for an independent t-test with 50 observations in each condition. The bell-shaped curve on the left represents the expectations if the null is true, and the red areas in the tail represent Type 1 errors. The bell-shaped curve on the right represents the expectations if the alternative hypothesis is true, and d = 0.5. The vertical line at d = 0.4 represents the critical effect size. With this sample size and an alpha level of 0.05, observed effect sizes smaller than d = 0.4 will not be statistically significant. If there is a true effect, these outcomes will be Type 2 errors, illustrated by the blue shaded area. The remainder of the curve reflects true positives, when there is a true effect, and the observed effect sizes are statistically significant. The power of the test is the percentages of the distribution on the right that is larger than the critical value.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Distribution of d = 0 and d = 0.5 for an independent t-test with n = 50.\n\n\n\n\nThe issue of Type 2 error control will be discussed in more detail in the chapter on sample size justification. Even though the topic of Type 2 error control is only briefly discussed here, it is at least as important as Type 1 error control. An informative study should have a high probability of observing an effect if there is an effect. Indeed, the default recommendation to aim for 80% power leaves a surprisingly large (20%) probability of a Type 2 error. If a researcher only cares about not making a decision error, but the researcher does not care about whether this decision error is a false positive or a false negative, an argument could be made that Type 1 and Type 2 errors are weighed equally. Therefore, desiging a study with balanced error rates (e.g., a 5% Type 1 error and 95% power) would make sense."

    "text": "2.8 Test Yourself\n\n2.8.1 Questions about the positive predictive value\nQ1: In the example at the start of this chapter, we see that we control the Type 1 error rate at 5% by using an alpha of 0.05. Still, when there is a 50% probability that \\(H_0\\) is true, the proportion of false positives for all experiments performed turns out to be much lower, namely 2.5%, or 0.025. Why?\n\n\nThe proportion of false positives for all experiments we have performed is a variable with a distribution around the true error rate – sometimes it’s higher, sometimes it’s lower, due to random variation.The proportion of false positives for all experiments we have performed is only 5% when \\(H_0\\) is true for all 200 studies.The proportion of false positives for all experiments we have performed is only 5% when you have 50% power – if power increases above 50%, the proportion of false positives for all experiments we have performed becomes smaller.The proportion of false positives for all experiments we have performed is only 5% when you have 100% power, and it becomes smaller if power is lower than 100%.\n\n\nQ2: What will make the biggest difference in improving the probability that you will find a true positive? Check your answer by shifting the sliders in the online PPV app at http://shinyapps.org/apps/PPV/ or https://shiny.ieis.tue.nl/PPV/\n\n\nIncrease the % of a-priori true hypothesesDecrease the % of a-priori true hypothesesIncrease the alpha levelDecrease the alpha levelIncrease the powerDecrease the power\n\n\nIncreasing the power requires bigger sample sizes, or studying larger effects. Increasing the % of a-priori true hypotheses can be done by making better predictions – for example building on reliable findings, and relying on strong theories. These are useful recommendations if you want to increase the probability of performing studies where you find a statistically significant result.\nQ3: Set the “% of a priori true hypotheses” slider to 50%. Leave the ‘\\(\\alpha\\) level’ slider at 5%. Leave the ‘% of p-hacked studies’ slider at 0. The title of Ioannidis’ paper is ‘why most published research findings are false’. One reason might be that studies often have low power. At which value for power is the PPV 50%. In other words, at which level of power is a significant result just as likely to be true, as that it is false?\n\n\n80%50%20%5%\n\n\nIt seems low power alone is not the best explanation for why most published findings might be false, as it is unlikely that power is low enough in the scientific literature. Ioannidis (2005) discusses some scenarios under which it becomes likely that most published research findings are false. Some of these assume that ‘p-hacked studies’, or studies that show a significant result due to bias, enter the literature. There are good reasons to believe this happens, as we discussed in this chapter. In the ‘presets by Ioannidis’ dropdown menu, you can select some of these situations. Explore all of them, and pay close attention to the ones where the PPV is smaller than 50%.\nQ4: In general, when are most published findings false?

Remember that you can click the ‘clipboard’ icon on the top right of the code section to copy all the code to your clipboard, and paste it in RStudio.\nQ2: If there is a true effect, we can only observe a true positive or a false negative. Change the effect size in the second line in the script from d &lt;- 0.0 to d &lt;- 0.3. This is a relatively small true effect, and with 200 participants in each condition, we have 85% power (or an 85% probability of finding a significant effect). Run the script again. Below is one possible example of the trajectory of p-values as the sample size increases. Run the script 20 times. Take a good look at the variation in the p-value trajectory. Remember that at N = 200, 85% of the times the p-value should have ended up below 0.05. The script returns the sample size the p-value is the lowest (which is often, but not always, at the maximum sample size, when there is a true effect) and the sample size at which the p-value drops below 0.05 for the first time. Which statement is true?\n\n\nIf the p-value drops below 0.05, it stays below 0.05.The p-value randomly moves between 0 and 1, and will every now and then end up below 0.05.The p-value often drops below 0.05 well before 200 participants in each condition. In around 50% of the simulations, this already happens at N = 100.The p-value will typically move below 0.05 and stay there for some time, but given a large enough sample, it will always move back up to p &gt; 0.05.\n\n\nQ3: Change the effect size in the second line of the script to d &lt;- 0.8, which can be regarded as a large effect. Run the script 20 times. Take a good look at the variation in the p-value trajectory. Which statement is true?\n\n\nThe p-value randomly moves between 0 and 1, and will every now and then end up below 0.05.The p-values drop below and stay below 0.05 much earlier than when the true effect size is 0.3.p-values are meaningful when effect sizes are large (e.g., d = 0.8), but meaningless when effect sizes are small (e.g., d = 0.3).When you examine a large effect, whenever a p-value drops below 0.05, it will always stay below 0.05 as the sample size increases.\n\n\nQ4: Looking at Figure 2.9, which statement is true?\n\n\nOptional stopping does not impact the Type 1 error rate.Optional stopping inflates the Type 1 error rate. We can see this in the first five bars (p-values between 0.00 and 0.05), which are substantially higher than the horizontal line.Optional stopping inflates the Type 1 error rate. We can see this in the bars just above 0.05, which dip substantially below the uniform distribution that should be present if there is no true effect.\n\n\nFor Questions 5 to 8, use the script below:\n\nN &lt;- 100 # total datapoints (per condition)\nlooks &lt;- 5 # set number of looks at the data\nnsims &lt;- 50000 # number of simulated studies\nalphalevel &lt;- 0.05 # set alphalevel\n\nif(looks &gt; 1){\n  look_at_n &lt;- ceiling(seq(N / looks, N, (N - (N / looks)) / (looks - 1)))\n}  else {\n  look_at_n &lt;- N\n}\nlook_at_n &lt;- look_at_n[look_at_n &gt; 2] # Remove looks at N of 1 or 2\nlooks&lt;-length(look_at_n) # if looks are removed, update number of looks\n\nmatp &lt;- matrix(NA, nrow = nsims, ncol = looks) # Matrix for p-values l tests\np &lt;- numeric(nsims) # Variable to save pvalues\n\n# Loop data generation for each study, then loop to perform a test for each N\nfor (i in 1:nsims) {\n  x &lt;- rnorm(n = N, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n  y &lt;- rnorm(n = N, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n  for (j in 1:looks) {\n    matp[i, j] &lt;- t.test(x[1:look_at_n[j]], y[1:look_at_n[j]], \n                         var.equal = TRUE)$p.value # perform the t-test, store\n  }\n  cat(\"Loop\", i, \"of\", nsims, \"\\n\")\n}\n\n# Save Type 1 error rate smallest p at all looks\nfor (i in 1:nsims) {\n  p[i] &lt;- ifelse(length(matp[i,which(matp[i,] &lt; alphalevel)]) == 0, \n                 matp[i,looks], matp[i,which(matp[i,] &lt; alphalevel)])\n}\n\nhist(p, breaks = 100, col = \"grey\") # create plot\nabline(h = nsims / 100, col = \"red\", lty = 3)\n\ncat(\"Type 1 error rates for look 1 to\", looks, \":\", \n    colSums(matp &lt; alphalevel) / nsims)\ncat(\"Type 1 error rate when only the lowest p-value for all looks is reported:\", \n    sum(p &lt; alphalevel) / nsims)\n\nQ5: The script to simulate optional stopping provides written output. One summary gives you the Type 1 error rate for each individual look. One summary gives the Type 1 error rate when optional stopping is used. When running the script with the default values, which statement is true?\n\n\nAt each look, the Type 1 error rate is higher than the alpha level (0.05). When using optional stopping (and reporting only the lowest p-value), the Type 1 error rate is higher than 0.05.At each look, the Type 1 error rate is approximately equal to the alpha level (0.05). When using optional stopping (and reporting only the lowest p-value), the alpha level also approximately equals the alpha level (0.05).At each look, the Type 1 error rate is approximately equal to the alpha level (0.05). When using optional stopping, the Type 1 error rate is higher than the alpha level (0.05).\n\n\nQ6: Change the number of looks in the simulation to 2 (change ‘looks &lt;- 5’ to ‘looks &lt;- 2’), and leave all other settings the same. Run the simulation again. What is the Type 1 error rate using optional stopping with only 1 interim analysis, rounded to 2 digits? (Note that due to small number of simulations, the exact alpha level you get might differ a little bit from the answer options below).\n\n\napproximately 0.05approximately 0.08approximately 0.12approximately 0.18\n\n\nQ7: As Wagenmakers (2007) notes: “a user of NHST could always obtain a significant result through optional stopping (i.e., analyzing the data as they accumulate and stopping the experiment whenever the p-value reaches some desired significance level)”. This is correct. It’s true that the p-value will always drop below the alpha level at some point in time. But, we need a rather large number of observations. We can calculate the maximum Type 1 error rate due to optional stopping for any maximum sample size. For example, what is the maximum Type 1 error rate when optional stopping is used when collecting 200 participants in each condition, and looking 200 times (or 198 times, given that you can’t perform a t-test on a sample size of 1 or 2 people)? Set the number of participants to 200, the number of looks to 200, the number of simulations to 10000 (this simulation will take even longer!), and the alpha to 0.05.\nWhat is maximum Type 1 error rate when collecting 200 participants in each condition of an independent t-test, using optional stopping, rounded to 2 digits? (Note that the simulation will take a while, but still, due to the relatively small number of simulations, the exact alpha level you get might differ a little bit from the answer options below – choose the answer option closest to your result).\n\n\n0.050.110.200.41\n\n\nQ8: At Wikipedia, look at the entry about the Pocock boundary: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocock_boundary . There are ethical reasons to look at the data, while data is being collected. These are clear in medicine, but similar arguments can be made for other research areas (see Lakens, 2014). Researchers often want to look at the data multiple times. This is perfectly fine, as long as they design a study with a number of looks in advance, and control their Type 1 error rate.\nThe Pocock boundary provides a very easy way to control the type 1 error rate in sequential analyses. Sequential analysis is the formal way to do optional stopping. Researchers should use a slightly lower alpha level for each look, the make sure the overall alpha level (after all looks) is not larger than 5%.\nSet the number of participants to 100, the number of looks to 5, and the number of simulations to 50000 (so back to the original script). In the Wikipedia article on the Pocock boundary, find the corrected alpha level for 5 looks at the data. Change the alpha level in the simulation to this value. Run the simulation. Which of the following statements is true?\n\n\nThe Type 1 error rate at each look is approximately 0.03, and the overall alpha level is approximately 0.05.The Type 1 error rate at each look is approximately 0.03, and the overall alpha level is approximately 0.15.The Type 1 error rate at each look is approximately 0.016, and the overall alpha level is approximately 0.05.The Type 1 error rate at each look is approximately 0.016, and the overall alpha level is approximately 0.08.\n\n\nQ9: Look at the graph of the p-value distribution when using the Pocock boundary, and compare it to the graph you got when not using the Pocock boundary. You can flip back and forth between plots you have generated in RStudio using the blue arrows on the plots tab. Which statement is true?\n\n\nWithout Pocock’s boundary, small p-values (e.g., p = 0.01) are more likely than slightly higher p-values (p = 0.04). With Pocock’s boundary, small p-values (e.g., p = 0.01) are also more likely than slightly higher p-values (p = 0.04).Without Pocock’s boundary, small p-values (e.g., p = 0.01) are more likely than slightly higher p-values (p = 0.04). With Pocock’s boundary, small p-values (e.g., p = 0.01) are less likely than slightly higher p-values (p = 0.04).Without Pocock’s boundary, small p-values (e.g., p = 0.01) are less likely than slightly higher p-values (p = 0.04). With Pocock’s boundary, small p-values (e.g., p = 0.01) are more likely than slightly higher p-values (p = 0.04).Without Pocock’s boundary, small p-values (e.g., p = 0.01) are less likely than slightly higher p-values (p = 0.04). With Pocock’s boundary, small p-values (e.g., p = 0.01) are also less likely than slightly higher p-values (p = 0.04).\n\n\n\n2.8.3 Open Questions\n\nWhat is the definition of the positive predictive value?\nWhat is the definition of a false positive?\nWhat is the definition of a false negative?\nWhat is the definition of a true positive?\nWhat is the definition of a true negative?\nIf you perform 200 studies, where there is a 50% probability H0 is true, you have 80% power, and use a 5% Type 1 error rate, what is the most likely outcome of a study?\nHow can you increase the positive predictive value in lines of research you decide to perform?\nWhy is it incorrect to think that “1 in 20 results in the published literature are Type 1 errors”?\nWhat is the problem with optional stopping?\nHow do multiple tests inflate the Type 1 error rate, and what can be done to correct for multiple comparisons?\nIn a replication study, what determines the probability that you will observe a significant effect?\nWhich approach to statistical inferences is the Neyman-Pearson approach part of, and what is the main goal of the Neyman-Pearson approach?\nHow should error rates (alpha and beta) in a statistical test be determined?\n\n\n\n\n\nBabbage, C.

    "text": "3.1 Likelihood ratios\nWe can use the likelihood function to compare possible values of p. For example, we might believe the coin we flipped was fair, even though we flipped eight out of ten heads. A fair coin will have p = 0.5, while we observed p = 0.8. The likelihood function allows us to compute the relative likelihood for different possible parameters. How much more likely is our observed data under the hypothesis that this is an unfair coin that will on average turn up heads 80% of the time, compared to the alternative theory that this is a fair coin which should turn up heads 50% of the time?\nWe can calculate the likelihood ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{L(p = 0.8)}{L(p = 0.5)}\n\\]\nWhich is 0.302/0.044 = 6.87. In the plot, both circles show the points on the likelihood curve for L(p = 0.5) and L(p = 0.8).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Computing a likelihood ratio for p = 0.5 relative to p = 0.8 when observing p = 0.8.\n\n\n\n\nWe can subjectively interpret this likelihood ratio, which tells us that our observed data is 6.87 times more likely under the hypothesis that this coin is unfair and will turn up heads 80% of the time, than under the hypothesis that this is a fair coin. How convincing is this? Let’s round the likelihood ratio to 7, and imagine two bags of marbles. One bag contains 7 blue marbles. The second contains 7 marbles, each one a different color of the rainbow, so violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. Someone randomly picks one of the two bags, draws a marble, and shows it to you. The marble is blue: How certain are you this marble came from the bag with all blue marbles, compared to the bag with rainbow coloured marbles? This is how strongly the likelihood ratio tells us to believe our data were generated by an unfair coin that turns up heads 80% of the time, relative to a fair coin, given that we have observed 8 heads in 10 tosses. After this explanation, intended to not make you rely too much on benchmarks, it might still be useful to know that Royall (1997) considered likelihood ratios of 8 as moderately strong evidence, and likelihood ratios of 32 as strong evidence.\nNote that likelihood ratios give us the relative evidence for one specified hypothesis, over another specified hypothesis. The likelihood ratio can be calculated for any two hypothesized values. For example, in Figure 3.6 below, the likelihood ratio is calculated that compares the hypothesis for a fair coin (p = 0.5) with the alternative hypothesis that the coin comes up heads 80% of the time (p = 0.8), when we have observed 4 heads out of 10 coin flips. We see that the observed data are 0.2050/0.0055=37.25 times more likely (ignoring rounding differences – and try to calculate these numbers by hand using the formula provided earlier) under the hypothesis that this is a fair coin than under the hypothesis that this is a coin that turns up heads 80% of the time.\n(ref:like6lab) Computing a likelihood ratio for p = 0.5 relative to p = 0.8 when observing p = 0.4.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Computing a likelihood ratio for p = 0.5 relative to p = 0.8 when observing p = 0.8.\n\n\n\n\nA likelihood ratio of 1 means the data are equally likely under both hypotheses. Values further away from 1 indicate that the data are more likely under one hypothesis than the other. The ratio can be expressed in favor of one hypothesis over the other (for example L(p = 0.5)/L(p = 0.8) or vice versa (L(p = 0.8)/L(p = 0.5). This means the likelihood ratio of 37.25 for \\(H_0\\) relative to \\(H_1\\) is equivalent to a likelihood ratio of 1/37.25 = 0.02685 for \\(H_1\\) relative to \\(H_0\\). Likelihood ratios range from 0 to infinity, and the closer to zero or infinity, the stronger the relative evidence for one hypothesis over the other. We will see in the chapter on Bayesian statistics that likelihood ratios are in this sense very similar (and a special case of) a Bayes Factor.\nLikelihoods are relative evidence. Just because the data are more likely under one possible value of p than another value of p doesn’t mean that the data have come from either of these two distributions. Other values might generate even higher likelihood values. For example, consider the situation where we flip a coin 100 times, and observe 50 heads. We compare p = 0.3 versus p = 0.8, and find that the likelihood ratio is 803462, implying that there is 803461 times more evidence in the data for p = 0.3 than for p = 0.8. That might sound pretty conclusive evidence for p = 0.3. But it is only relative evidence for p = 0.3 compared to p = 0.8. If we look at the likelihood function, we clearly see that, not surprisingly, p = 0.5 is the value that maximizes the likelihood function. Just because one hypothesis is more likely than another hypothesis, does not mean that there isn’t a third hypothesis that is even more likely.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Computing a likelihood ratio for p = 0.3 relative to p = 0.8 when observing p = 0.5 in 100 coin flips."

    "text": "3.2 Likelihood of mixed results in sets of studies\nScience is a cumulative process, and we should evaluate lines of research, not single studies. One big problem in the scientific literature is that nonsignificant results are often never published (Fanelli, 2010; Franco et al., 2014). At the same time, because the statistical power of hypothesis tests are never 100% (and often much lower), it is a mathematical reality that it is unlikely (or “too good to be true”) that a set of multiple studies yields exclusively significant results. (Francis, 2014; Schimmack, 2012). We can use binomial likelihoods to examine how likely it is to observe mixed results, and understand when mixed results are nevertheless strong evidence for the presence of an effect. The following is largely based on Lakens & Etz (2017).\nThe probability of observing a significant or nonsignificant result in a study depends on the Type 1 error rate (\\(\\alpha\\)), the statistical power of the test (1-\\(\\beta\\)), and the probability that the null hypothesis is true (Wacholder et al., 2004). There are four possible outcomes of a study: a true positive, a false positive, a true negative, and a false negative. When \\(H_0\\) is true, the probability of observing a false positive depends on the \\(\\alpha\\) level or the Type 1 error rate (e.g., 5%). When \\(H_1\\) is true, the probability of observing a true positive depends on the statistical power of the performed test (where an often recommended minimum is 80%), which in turn depends on the \\(\\alpha\\) level, the true effect size, and the sample size. With an \\(\\alpha\\) level of 5%, and when \\(H_0\\) is true, a false positive will occur with a 5% probability (as long as error rates are controlled, e.g., in preregistered studies) and true negative will occur with a 95% probability. When a test has 80% power, and \\(H_1\\) is true, a true positive has a probability of 80%, and a false negative has a probability of 20%.\nIf we perform multiple studies, we can calculate the binomial probability that we will observe a specific number of significant and non-significant findings (Ioannidis & Trikalinos, 2007). We can calculate the probability of finding exactly two significant results out of three studies assuming the null hypothesis is true. When \\(H_0\\) is true, the probability of significant results equals the \\(\\alpha\\) level, and thus when the \\(\\alpha\\) level is carefully controlled (e.g., in preregistered studies) the probability of observing a significant result (p) = 0.05. That is, when k = 2, n = 3, and p = .05, the binomial probability function tells us that the probability of finding exactly two significant results in three studies is 0.007 (0.05 × 0.05 × 0.95 = 0.002375, and there are three orders in which two of the three results can be observed, so 0.002375 × 3 = 0.007).\nTo calculate the likelihood assuming \\(H_1\\) is true, we need to make an assumption about the power in each study. Let’s provisionally assume all studies were powered at 80% and thus p = .80. The probability of observing exactly two significant results in three studies, assuming a power of 0.8, is 0.384 (0.8 × 0.8 × 0.2 = 0.128, and with three orders in which two of the three results can be significant, 0.128 × 3 = 0.384). In other words, if you set out to perform 3 studies, your hypothesis is correct, and you test your hypothesis with 80% power, there is a 38.4% probability of observing 2 out of 3 significant results, and a 9.6% probability to observe 1 out of 3 significant results (and for an extremely unlucky individual, a 0.8% probability of not finding any significant results in three studies, even though there is a true effect). Unless power is extremely high, mixed results should be expected in sets of studies.\nBoth likelihoods at p = .05 and p = .80 are highlighted in Figure 3.8 by the circles on the dotted vertical lines.We can use the likelihood of the data assuming \\(H_0\\) or \\(H_1\\) is true to calculate the likelihood ratio, 0.384/0.007 = 53.89, which tells us the observed outcome of exactly two significant results out of three studies is 53.89 times more likely when \\(H_1\\) is true and studies had 80% power, than when \\(H_0\\) is true and studies have a carefully controlled 5% Type 1 error rate. Likelihood ratios of 8 and 32 have been proposed as benchmarks of moderately strong and strong evidence, respectively (Royall, 1997), which implies that finding two significant results out of the three studies could be considered strong evidence for \\(H_1\\), assuming 80% power. A Shiny app to perform these calculations is available here.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Computing a likelihood ratio for two out of three significant results, assuming an alpha of 5% and 80% power.\n\n\n\n\nIn sets of studies, the likelihood ratio in favor of \\(H_1\\) versus \\(H_0\\) after observing a mix of significant and nonsignificant findings can become surprisingly large. Even though the evidence appears to be mixed, there is actually strong evidence in favor of a true effect. For example, when a researcher performs six studies with 80% power and a 5% alpha level and finds three significant outcomes and three nonsignificant outcomes, the cumulative likelihood ratio is convincingly large at 38-to-1 in favor of \\(H_1\\) to consider the set of studies strong evidence for a true effect. Intuitively, researchers might not feel convinced by a set of studies where three out of six results were statistically significant. But if we do the math, we see that such a set of studies can be very strong evidence in favor of a true effect. A better understanding of these probabilities might be an important step in mitigating the negative effects of publication bias.\nHopefully, researchers become more inclined to submit nonsignificant findings for publication when they have a better understanding of the evidential value in lines of research with mixed results. Publishing all performed studies in lines of research will reduce publication bias, and increase the informational value of the data in the scientific literature. Expecting all studies in lines of research to be statistically significant is not reasonable, and it is important that researchers develop more realistic expectations if they are to draw meaningful inferences from lines of research. We don’t have a very good feeling for what real patterns of studies look like, because we are continuously exposed to a scientific literature that does not reflect reality. Almost all multiple study papers in the scientific literature present only statistically significant results, even though this is unlikely given the power of these studies, and the probability that we would only study correct predictions (Scheel et al., 2021). Educating researchers about binomial probabilities and likelihood ratios is a straightforward way to develop more realistic expectations about what research lines that contain evidential value in favor of \\(H_1\\) actually look like."

    "text": "3.3 Likelihoods for t-tests\nSo far we have computed likelihoods for binomial probabilities, but likelihoods can be computed for any statistical model (Glover & Dixon, 2004; Pawitan, 2001). For example, we can compute the relative likelihood of observing a t-value under the null and an alternative hypothesis as illustrated in Figure 3.9. Of course, the observed data is most likely if we assume the observed effect equals the true effect, but examining the likelihood reveals that there are many alternative hypotheses that are relatively more likely than the null hypothesis. This also holds when observing non-significant results, which can be more likely under an alternative hypothesis of interest, than under the null hypothesis. This is a reason why it is incorrect to say that there is no effect when p &gt; \\(\\alpha\\) (see p-value misconception 1).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: Likelihood ratio for observed t-value under \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\)."

Copy the code below (remember that you can click the ‘clipboard’ icon on the top right of the code section to copy all the code to your clipboard), and plot the likelihood curves for 0 heads (x &lt;- 0) out of 10 flips (n &lt;- 10) by running the script.

Flip it 13 times, and count the number of heads. Using the code above, calculate the likelihood of your observed results under the hypothesis that your coin is fair, compared to the hypothesis that the coin is not fair. Set the number of successes (x) to the number of heads you observed. Change \\(H_1\\) to the number of heads you have observed (or leave it to 0 if you didn’t observe any heads at all!). You can just use 4/13, or enter 0.3038. Leave \\(H_0\\) at 0.5. Run the script to calculate the likelihood ratio. What is the likelihood ratio of a fair compared to a non-fair coin (or \\(H_0\\)/\\(H_1\\)) that flips heads as often as you have observed, based on the observed data? Round your answer to 2 digits after the decimal.\n\nQ4: Earlier we mentioned that with increasing sample sizes, we had collected stronger relative evidence. Let’s say we would want to compare L(p = 0.4) with L(p = 0.5). What is the likelihood ratio if \\(H_1\\) is 0.4, \\(H_0\\) is 0.5, and you flip 5 heads in 10 trials? From the two possible ways to calculate the likelihood ratio (\\(H_1\\)/\\(H_0\\) and \\(H_0\\)/\\(H_1\\)), report the likelihood that is ≥ 1, and round to 2 digits after the decimal point.\n\nQ5: What is the likelihood ratio if \\(H_1\\) is 0.4, \\(H_0\\) is 0.5, and you flip 50 heads in 100 trials?

From the two possible ways to calculate the likelihood ratio (\\(H_1\\)/\\(H_0\\) and \\(H_0\\)/\\(H_1\\)), report the likelihood that is ≥ 1, and round to 2 digits after the decimal point.\n\nQ7: When comparing two hypotheses (p = X vs p = Y), a likelihood ratio of:\n\n\n0.02 means that there is not enough evidence in the data for either of the two hypotheses.5493 means that hypothesis p = X is most supported by the data.5493 means that hypothesis p = X is much more supported by the data than p = Y.0.02 means that the hypothesis that the data are 2% more likely under the hypothesis that p = X than under the hypothesis that p = Y.\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Questions about mixed results\nA Shiny app to perform the calculations is available here.\nQ8: Which statement is correct when you perform 3 studies?\n\n\nWhen \\(H_1\\) is true, alpha = 0.05, and power = 0.80, it is almost as likely to observe one or more non-significant results (48.8%) as it is to observe only significant result (51.2%).When alpha = 0.05 and power = 0.80, it is extremely rare that you will find 3 significant results (0.0125%), regardless of whether \\(H_0\\) is true or \\(H_1\\) is true.When alpha = 0.05 and power = 0.80, 2 out of 3 statistically significant results is the most likely outcome of all possible outcomes (0 out of 3, 1 out of 3, 2 out of 3, or 3 out of 3), and occurs 38.4% of the time when \\(H_1\\) is true.When alpha = 0.05 and power = 0.80, the probability of finding at least one false positive (a significant result when \\(H_0\\) is true) in three studies is 5%.\n\n\nQ9: Sometimes in lines of three studies, you’ll find a significant effect in one study, but there is no effect in the other two related studies. Assume the two related studies were not exactly the same in every way (e.g., you have changed the manipulation, or the procedure, or some of the questions). It could be that the two other studies did not work because of minor differences that had some effect you do not fully understand yet. Or it could be that the single significant result was a Type 1 error, and \\(H_0\\) was true in all three studies. Which statement below is correct, assuming a 5% Type 1 error rate and 80% power?\n\n\nAll else being equal, the probability of a Type 1 error in one of three studies is 5% when there is no true effect in all three studies, and the probability of finding exactly 1 in three significant effects, assuming 80% power in all three studies, is 80%, which is substantially more likely.All else being equal, the probability of a Type 1 error in one of three studies is 13.5% when there is no true effect in all three studies, and the probability of finding exactly 1 in three significant effects, assuming 80% power in all three studies (and thus a true effect), is 9.6%, which is slightly, but not substantially less likely.All else being equal, the probability of a Type 1 error in one of three studies is 85.7% when there is no true effect in all three studies, and the probability of finding exactly 1 in three significant effects, assuming 80% power in all three studies (and thus a true effect) (and thus a true effect), is 0.8%, which is substantially less likely.It is not possible to know the probability you will observe a Type 1 error if you perform 3 studies.\n\n\nThe idea that most studies have 80% power is slightly optimistic. Examine the correct answer to the previous question across a range of power values (e.g., 50% power, and 30% power).\nQ10: Several papers suggest it is a reasonable assumption that the power in the psychological literature might be around 50%. Set the number of studies to 4, the number of successes also to 4, and the assumed power slider to 50%, and look at the table at the bottom of the app. How likely is it to observe 4 significant results in 4 studies, assuming there is a true effect?\n\n\n6.25%12.5%25%37.5%\n\n\nImagine you perform 4 studies, and 3 show a significant result. Change these numbers in the online app. Leave the power at 50%. The output in the text tells you:\nWhen the observed results are equally likely under \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\), the likelihood ratio is 1. Benchmarks to interpret Likelihood Ratios suggest that when 1&lt;LR&lt;8 there is weak evidence, when 8&lt;LR&lt;32 there is moderate evidence, and when LR&gt;32, there is strong evidence.\nThe data are more likely under the alternative hypothesis than the null hypothesis with a likelihood ratio of 526.32\nThese calculations show that, assuming you have observed three significant results out of four studies, and assuming each study had 50% power, it is 526 times more likely to have observed these data when the alternative hypothesis is true, than when the null hypothesis is true. In other words, it is 526 times more likely to find a significant effect in three studies when you have 50% power, than to find three Type 1 errors in a set of four studies.\nQ11: Maybe you don’t think 50% power is a reasonable assumption. How low can the power be (rounded to 2 digits), for the likelihood to remain higher than 32 in favor of \\(H_1\\) when observing 3 out of 4 significant results?\n\n\n5% power17% power34% power44% power\n\n\nThe main take home message of these calculations is to understand that 1) mixed results are supposed to happen, and 2) mixed results can contain strong evidence for a true effect, across a wide range of plausible power values. The app also tells you how much evidence, in a rough dichotomous way, you can expect. This is useful for our educational goal. But when you want to evaluate results from multiple studies, the formal way to do so is by performing a meta-analysis.\nThe above calculations make a very important assumption: The Type 1 error rate is controlled at 5%. If you try out many different tests in each study, and only report the result that yielded a p &lt; 0.05, these calculations no longer hold.\nQ12: Go back to the default settings of 2 out of 3 significant results, but now set the Type 1 error rate to 20%, to reflect a modest amount of p-hacking. Under these circumstances, what is the highest likelihood in favor of \\(H_1\\) you can get if you explore all possible values for the true power?\n\n\nApproximately 1Approximately 4.63Approximately 6.70Approximately 62.37\n\n\nAs the scenario above shows, p-hacking makes studies extremely uninformative. If you inflate the error rate, you quickly destroy the evidence in the data. You can no longer determine whether the data is more likely when there is no effect, than when there is an effect. Sometimes researchers complain that people who worry about p-hacking and try to promote better Type 1 error control are missing the point, and that other things (better measurement, better theory, etc.) are more important. I fully agree that these aspects of scientific research are at least as important as better error control. But better measures and theories will require decades of work. Better error control can be accomplished today, if researchers would stop inflating their error rates by flexibly analyzing their data. And as this assignment shows, inflated rates of false positives very quickly make it difficult to learn what is true from the data we collect. Because of the relative ease with which this part of scientific research can be improved, and because we can achieve this today (and not in a decade) I think it is worth stressing the importance of error control, and publish more realistic looking sets of studies.\nQ13: Some ‘prestigious’ journals (which, when examined in terms of scientific quality such as reproducibility, reporting standards, and policies concerning data and material sharing, are quite low quality despite their prestige) only publish manuscripts with a large number of studies, which should all be statistically significant. If we assume an average power in psychology of 50%, only 3.125% of 5 study articles should contain exclusively significant results. If you pick up a random issue from such a prestigious journal, and see 10 articles, each reporting 5 studies, and all manuscripts have exclusively significant results, would you trust the reported findings more, or less, than when all these articles had reported mixed results? Why?\nQ14: Unless you will power all your studies at 99.99% for the rest of your career (which would be slightly inefficient, but great if you don’t like insecurity), you will observe mixed results in lines of research. How do you plan to deal with mixed results in lines of research?\n\n3.4.3 Open Questions\n\nWhat is the difference between a probability and a likelihood?\nWhy is it important to remember that a likelihood ratio is relative evidence?\nIf we compare 2 hypotheses, H0 and H1, and the likelihood ratio of H1 compared to H0 is 77, what does this mean?\nWhat are benchmarks for medium and strong evidence according to Royall?\nHow can it be that a likelihood ratio is 200, but both hypotheses are incorrect?\nIf we perform multiple studies and find 2 out of 3 studies show a significant results, how can this actually be strong evidence for H1?\n\n\n\n\n\nAldrich, J.

    "section": "\n4.1 Bayes factors",
    "text": "4.1 Bayes factors\nOne approach in Bayesian statistics focuses on the comparison of different models that might explain the data (referred to as model comparison). In Bayesian statistics, the probability of data under a specified model (P|D(\\(H_0\\)) is a number that expressed what is sometimes referred to as the absolute evidence, and more formally referred to as a marginal likelihood. The marginal likelihood uses prior probabilities to average the likelihood across the parameter space. For example, assume we have a simple model M that is based on a single parameter, that can take on two values, X and Y, and that a-prior we believe the probability of both values is p(X) = 0.4 and p(Y) = 0.6. We collect data, and calculate the likelihood for both these parameter values, which is p(D|X) = 0.02 and p(D|Y) = 0.08. The marginal likelihood of our model M is then P(D|M) = 0.4 × 0.02 + 0.6 × 0.08 = 0.056. Most often, models have continuously varying parameters, and the marginal likelihood formula is based on an integral, but the idea remains the same.\nA comparison of two models is based on the relative evidence the data provides for each models we are comparing. The relative evidence is calculated by dividing the marginal likelihood for one model by the marginal likelihood for another model, and this ratio of relative evidence based on these marginal likelihoods is called the Bayes factor. Bayes factors are the Bayesian equivalent of hypothesis tests (Dienes, 2008; Kass & Raftery, 1995). The Bayes factor represents how much we have updated our beliefs, based on observing the data. We can express Bayes factors to indicate how much more likely \\(H_1\\) has become given the data compared to \\(H_0\\) (often indicated by B10) or as how much more likely \\(H_0\\) has become compared to \\(H_1\\) (B01), and B10 = 1/B01. Similar to likelihood ratios of 1, a Bayes factor of 1 does not change our beliefs in favor of one model compared to the other model. A very large Bayes factor for \\(H_1\\) over \\(H_0\\) increases our belief in \\(H_1\\) relative to \\(H_0\\), and a Bayes Factor close to 0 increases our belief in \\(H_0\\) relative to \\(H_1\\). If our prior belief in \\(H_1\\) was very, very low (e.g., your belief in unicorns) even a large Bayes Factor that supports the presence of a unicorn might not yet convince you that unicorns are real – but you have updated your belief in unicorns, and now believe they are at least more likely then they were before (even if you still think unicorns are very unlikely to exist). The contribution of the Bayes Factor and the prior in calculating the posterior odds is clear in the following formula:\n\\[\n\\frac{P(H_1|D)}{P(H_0|D)} = \\ \\frac{P(D|H_1)}{P(D|H_0)}\\  \\times \\ \\frac{P(H_1)}{P(H_0)}\n\\]\n\\[\nPosterior\\ Probability = \\ Bayes\\ Factor\\  \\times \\ Prior\\ Probability\n\\]\nA Bayesian analysis of data requires specifying the prior. Here, we will continue our example based on a binomial probability, such as a coin flip. In the likelihood example, we compared two point hypotheses (e.g., p = 0.5 vs. p = 0.8). In Bayesian statistics, parameters are considered to be random variables, and the uncertainty or degree of belief with respect to the parameters is quantified by probability distributions.\nA binomial probability lies between 0 and 1. You could draw any probability density you want over 0 and 1, and turn it into a prior, but for good reasons (simplicity, mostly) a beta-prior is often used for binomial probabilities. The shape of the beta-prior depends on two parameters, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). Note that these are the same Greek letters as used for the Type 1 error rate and Type 2 error rate, but that is purely coincidental! The \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) in binomial probabilities are unrelated to error rates, and the use of the same letters is mainly due to a lack of creativity among statisticians and the limited choice the alphabet gives us. It also does not help that \\(\\beta\\) is one of the parameters of the Beta distribution. Try to keep these different Beta’s apart! The probability density function is:\n\\[\nf{}^{}{\\left(x;\\ \\alpha,\\ \\beta \\right) = \\ \\frac{1}{B(\\alpha,\\beta)}}x^{\\alpha - 1}{(1 - x)}^{\\beta - 1}\n\\]\nwhere B(\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\)) is the beta function. Understanding the mathematical basis of this function is beyond the scope of this chapter, but you can read more on Wikipedia or Kruschke’s book on Doing Bayesian Data Analysis (Kruschke, 2014). The beta-prior for a variety of values for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) can be seen in Figure 4.1.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Four examples of Bayesian priors.\n\n\n\n\nThese beta densities reflect different types of priors. Let’s assume you are approached by a street merchant who tries to sell you a special coin with heads and tails that, when flipped, will almost always turn up heads. The \\(\\alpha\\) = 1, \\(\\beta\\) = 1 prior is what a newborn baby would have as a prior, without any idea of what to expect when you flip a coin, and thus every value of p is equally likely. The \\(\\alpha\\) = 1, \\(\\beta\\) = 1/2 prior is what a true believer would have as a prior. The sales merchant tells you the coin will turn up heads almost every time, and thus, you believe it will turn up heads almost every time. The \\(\\alpha\\) = 4, \\(\\beta\\) = 4, and the \\(\\alpha\\) = 100, \\(\\beta\\) = 100 priors are for slightly and extremely skeptical people. With an \\(\\alpha\\) = 4, \\(\\beta\\) = 4 prior, you expect the coin will be fair, but you are willing to believe a wide range of other true values is possible (the curve is centered on 0.5, but the curve is wide, allowing for very high and low values of p). With the \\(\\alpha\\) = 100, \\(\\beta\\) = 100 prior you are really convinced coins are fair, and believe there will be only a very slight bias, at most (the curve is again centered on 0.5, and a skeptic believes the p will lie between 0.4 and 0.6 – a much narrower range compared to the slightly skeptic individual).\nLet’s assume the newborn baby, the true believer, the slightly skeptic and the extreme skeptic all buy the coin, flip it n = 20 times, and observe x = 10 heads. This outcome can be plotted as a binomial distribution with 10 heads out of 20 trials, or as a Beta(11, 11) distribution.\nThe newborn baby had a prior Beta distribution with \\(\\alpha\\) = 1 and \\(\\beta\\) = 1, which equals a binomial likelihood distribution for 0 heads out of 0 trials. The posterior is a Beta distribution with Beta(\\(\\alpha\\)*, \\(\\beta\\)*), where:\n\\(\\alpha\\)* = \\(\\alpha\\) + x = 1 + 10= 11\n\\(\\beta\\)* = \\(\\beta\\) + n – x = 1 + 20 – 10 = 11\nOr calculating these values more directly from the \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) of the prior and likelihood:\n\\(\\alpha\\)* = \\(\\alpha\\)prior + \\(\\alpha\\)likelihood – 1 = 1 + 11 - 1= 11\n\\(\\beta\\)* = \\(\\beta\\)prior + \\(\\beta\\)likelihood - 1 = 1 + 11 – 1 = 11\nThus, the posterior distribution for the newborn is a Beta(11,11) distribution. This equals a binomial likelihood function for 10 heads out of 20 trials, or Beta(11,11) distribution. In other words, the posterior distribution is identical to the likelihood function when a uniform prior is used.\nTake a look at Figure 4.2. Given 10 heads out of 20 coin flips, we see the prior distribution of the newborn (the horizontal grey line), the likelihood (the blue dotted line) and the posterior (the black line).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Four examples of how different priors are updated based on data to the posterior.\n\n\n\n\nFor the true believer the posterior distribution is not centered on the maximum likelihood of the observed data, but just a bit in the direction of the prior. The slightly skeptic and the strong skeptic end up with a much stronger belief in a fair coin after observing the data, but mainly because they already had a stronger prior that the coin was fair."

    "text": "4.2 Updating our belief\nNow that we have a distribution for the prior, and a distribution for the posterior, we can see in the graphs below for which values of p our belief has increased. Everywhere where the black line (of the posterior) is higher than the grey line (of the prior) our belief in that p has increased.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Plot for the prior, likelihood, and posterior.\n\n\n\n\nThe Bayes Factor is used to quantify this increase in relative evidence. Let’s calculate the Bayes Factor for the hypothesis that the coin is fair for the newborn. The Bayes Factor is simply the value of the posterior distribution at p = 0.5, divided by the value of the prior distribution at p = 0.5:\nBF10 = Beta(p = 0.5, 11, 11)/Beta(p = 0.5, 1, 1) = 3.70/1 = 3.70\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can calculate and plot the Bayes Factor, and show the prior (grey), likelihood (dashed blue) and posterior (black). For the example of 20 flips, 10 heads, and the newborn prior, the plot looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Plot for the prior, likelihood, and posterior.\n\n\n\n\nWe see that for the newborn, p = 0.5 has become more probable, but so has p = 0.4. Now let’s assume the strong skeptic, who believes the coin is fair with a prior of Beta(100, 100), buys the coin and flips it 100 times. Surprisingly, the coin comes up heads 90 out of 100 flips. The plot of the prior, likelihood, and posterior now looks much more extreme, because we had a very informed prior, and extremely different data. We see the grey prior distribution, the dashed blue likelihood based on the data, and the posterior distribution in black. The Bayes Factor of 0 (note that the value is rounded, and is extremely small, but not exactly zero) - represents the substantial drop in belief that the coin is fair – indeed, this now seems an untenable hypothesis, even for the strong skeptic. It shows how data can update your belief. Where a newborn would now completely believe that the true p for the coin is somewhere around 0.9, the strong skeptic has more reason to believe the p is around 0.65, due to the strong prior conviction that the coin is fair. Given enough data, even this strong skeptic will become convinced that the coin will return heads most of the time as well.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Plot for the prior, likelihood, and posterior.\n\n\n\n\nWe can now also see the difference between a likelihood inference approach, and a Bayesian inference approach. In likelihood inference, you can compare different values of p for the same likelihood curve (e.g., p = 0.5 vs p = 0.8) and calculate the likelihood ratio. In Bayesian inference, you can compare the difference between the prior and the posterior for the same value of p, and calculate the Bayes Factor.\nIf you have never seen Bayes Factors before, you might find it difficult to interpret the numbers. As with any guideline (e.g., interpreting effect sizes as small, medium, and large) there is criticism on the use of benchmarks. On the other hand, you have to start somewhere in getting a feel for what Bayes Factors mean. A Bayes factor between 1 and 3 is considered ‘not worth more than a bare mention’, larger than 3 (or smaller than 1/3) is considered ‘substantial’, and larger than 10 (or smaller than 1/10) is considered ‘strong’ (Jeffreys, 1939). These labels refer to the increase in how much you believe a specific hypothesis, not in the posterior belief in that hypothesis. If you think extra-sensory perception is extremely implausible, a single study with a BF = 14 will increase your belief, but you will now think extra-sensory perception is pretty much extremely implausible.\nBayes factors are often promoted as an alternative to p-values. One stated benefit is that they can provide support both for the alternative, as for the null (Dienes, 2014). However, the same can be achieved with frequentist equivalence tests, as we will see in the chapter on equivalence testing, and inferences based on Bayes factors and equivalence tests typically lead to the same conclusions (Lakens et al., 2020). Another reason that some people give to switch to Bayes factors instead of p-values is that, as we saw in the chapter on p-values, p-values are often misunderstood. However, not surprisingly, Bayes factors are at least as often misunderstood and misused (Wong et al., 2022). Statistical inferences are hard, and thinking about probabilities is not something we get right by trusting our intuition. We need to train ourselves to draw correct inferences, and switching to a different statistic will not prevent misuse."

    "section": "\n4.3 Preventing common misconceptions about Bayes Factors",
    "text": "4.3 Preventing common misconceptions about Bayes Factors\nAs more people have started to use Bayes Factors, we should not be surprised that misconceptions about Bayes Factors have become common. A recent study shows that the percentage of scientific articles that draw incorrect inferences based on observed Bayes Factors is distressingly high (Wong et al., 2022), with 92% of articles demonstrating at least one misconception of Bayes Factors.\n\n4.3.1 Misunderstanding 1: Confusing Bayes Factors with Posterior Odds.\nOne common criticism by Bayesians of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is that NHST quantifies the probability of the data (or more extreme data), given that the null hypothesis is true, but that scientists should be interested in the probability that the hypothesis is true, given the data. Cohen (1994) wrote:\n\nWhat’s wrong with NHST? Well, among many other things, it does not tell us what we want to know, and we so much want to know what we want to know that, out of desperation, we nevertheless believe that it does! What we want to know is “Given these data, what is the probability that Ho is true?”\n\nOne might therefore believe that Bayes factors tell us something about the probability that a hypothesis true, but this is incorrect. A Bayes factor quantifies how much we should update our belief in one hypothesis. If this hypothesis was extremely unlikely (e.g., the probability that people have telepathy) this hypothesis might still be very unlikely, even after computing a large Bayes factor in a single study demonstrating telepathy. If we believed the hypothesis that people have telepathy was unlikely to be true (e.g., we thought it was 99.9% certain telepathy was not true) evidence for telepathy might only increase our belief in telepathy to the extent that we now believe it is 98% unlikely. The Bayes factor only corresponds to our posterior belief if we were perfectly uncertain about the hypothesis being true or not. If both hypotheses were equally likely, and a Bayes factor indicates we should update our belief in such a way that the alternative hypothesis is three times more likely than the null hypothesis, only then would we end up believing the alternative hypothesis is exactly three times more likely than the null hypothesis. One should therefore not conclude that, for example, given a BF of 10, the alternative hypothesis is more likely to be true than the null hypothesis. The correct claim is that people should update their belief in the alternative hypothesis by a factor of 10.\n\n4.3.2 Misunderstanding 2: Failing to interpret Bayes Factors as relative evidence.\nOne benefit of Bayes factors that is often mentioned by Bayesians is that, unlike NHST, Bayes factors can provide support for the null hypothesis, and thereby falsify predictions. It is true that NHST can only reject the null hypothesis, although it is important to add that in frequentist statistics equivalence tests can be used to reject the alternative hypothesis, and therefore there is no need to switch to Bayes factors to meaningfully interpret the results of non-significant null hypothesis tests.\nBayes factors quantify support for one hypothesis relative to another hypothesis. As with likelihood ratios (and as illustrated in Figure 3.7), it is possible that one hypothesis is supported more than another hypothesis, while both hypotheses are actually false. It is incorrect to interpret Bayes factors in an absolute manner, for example by stating that a Bayes factor of 0.09 provides support for the null hypothesis. The correct interpretation is that the Bayes factor provides relative support for H0 compared to H1. With a different alternative model, the Bayes factor would change. As with a significant equivalence tests, even a Bayes factor strongly supporting H0 does not mean there is no effect at all - there could be a true, but small, effect.\nFor example, after Daryl Bem (2011) published 9 studies demonstrating support for pre-cognition (conscious cognitive awareness of a future event that could not otherwise be known) a team of Bayesian statisticians re-analyzed the studies, and concluded “Out of the 10 critical tests, only one yields “substantial” evidence for H1, whereas three yield “substantial” evidence in favor of H0. The results of the remaining six tests provide evidence that is only “anecdotal”” (2011). In a reply, Bem and Utts (2011) reply by arguing that the set of studies provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis, if the Bayes factors are computed as relative evidence between the null hypothesis and a more realistically specified alternative hypothesis, where the effects of pre-cognition are expected to be small. This back and forth illustrates how Bayes factors are relative evidence, and a change in the alternative model specification changes whether the null or the alternative hypothesis receives relatively more support given the data.\n\n4.3.3 Misunderstanding 3: Not specifying the null and/or alternative model.\nGiven that Bayes factors are relative evidence for or against one model compared to another model, it might be surprising that many researchers fail to specify the alternative model to begin with when reporting their analysis. And yet, in a systematic review of how psychologist use Bayes factors, van de Schoot et al. (2017) found that “31.1% of the articles did not even discuss the priors implemented”. Where in a null hypothesis significance test researchers do not need to specify the model that the test is based on, as the test is by definition a test against an effect of 0, and the alternative model consists of any non-zero effect size (in a two-sided test), this is not true when computing Bayes factors. The null model when computing Bayes factors is often (but not necessarily) a point null as in NHST, but the alternative model only one of many possible alternative hypotheses that a researcher could test against. It has become common to use ‘default’ priors, but as with any heuristic, defaults will most often give an answer to a nonsensical question, and quickly become a form of mindless statistics. When introducing Bayes factors as an alternative to frequentist t-tests, Rouder et al. (2009) write:\n\nThis commitment to specify judicious and reasoned alternatives places a burden on the analyst. We have provided default settings appropriate to generic situations. Nonetheless, these recommendations are just that and should not be used blindly. Moreover, analysts can and should consider their goals and expectations when specifying priors. Simply put, principled inference is a thoughtful process that cannot be performed by rigid adherence to defaults.\n\nThe priors used when computing a Bayes factor should therefore be both specified and justified.\n\n4.3.4 Misunderstanding 4: Claims based on Bayes Factors do not require error control.\nIn a paper with the provocative title “Optional stopping: No problem for Bayesians” Rouder (2014) argues that “Researchers using Bayesian methods may employ optional stopping in their own research and may provide Bayesian analysis of secondary data regardless of the employed stopping rule.” If one would merely read the title and abstract, a reader might come to the conclusion that Bayes factors a wonderful solution to the error inflation due to optional stopping in the frequentist framework, but this is not correct (de Heide & Grünwald, 2017).\nThere is a big caveat about the type of statistical inferences that is unaffected by optional stopping. Optional stopping is no problem for Bayesians if they refrain from making a dichotomous claim about the presence or absence of an effect, or when they refrain from drawing conclusions about a prediction being supported or falsified. Rouder notes how “Even with optional stopping, a researcher can interpret the posterior odds as updated beliefs about hypotheses in light of data.” In other words, even after optional stopping, a Bayes factor tells researchers who much they should update their belief in a hypothesis. Importantly, when researchers make dichotomous claims based on Bayes factors (e.g., “The effect did not differ significantly between the condition, BF10 = 0.17”) then this claim can be correct, or an error, and error rates become a relevant consideration, unlike when researchers simply present the Bayes factor for readers to update their personal beliefs.\nBayesians disagree among each other about whether Bayes factors should be the basis of dichotomous claims, or not. Those who promote the use of Bayes factors to make claims often refer to thresholds proposed by Jeffreys (1939), where a BF &gt; 3 is “substantial evidence”, and a BF &gt; 10 is considered “strong evidence”. Some journals, such as Nature Human Behavior, have the following requirement for researchers who submit a Registered Report: “For inference by Bayes factors, authors must be able to guarantee data collection until the Bayes factor is at least 10 times in favour of the experimental hypothesis over the null hypothesis (or vice versa).” When researchers decide to collect data until a specific threshold is crossed to make a claim about a test, their claim can be correct, or wrong, just as when p-values are the statistical quantity a claim is based on. As both the Bayes factor and the p-value can be computed based on the sample size and the t-value (Francis, 2016; Rouder et al., 2009), there is nothing special about using Bayes factors as the basis of an ordinal claim. The exact long run error rates can not be directly controlled when computing Bayes factors, and the Type 1 and Type 2 error rate depends on the choice of the prior and the choice for the cut-off used to decide to make a claim. Simulations studies show that for commonly used priors and a BF &gt; 3 cut-off to make claims the Type 1 error rate is somewhat smaller, but the Type 2 error rate is considerably larger (Kelter, 2021).\nTo conclude this section, whenever researchers make claims, they can make erroneous claims, and error control should be a worthy goal. Error control is not a consideration when researchers do not make ordinal claims (e.g., X is larger than Y, there is a non-zero correlation between X and Y, etc). If Bayes factors are used to quantify how much researchers should update personal beliefs in a hypothesis, there is no need to consider error control, but researchers should also refrain from making any ordinal claims based on Bayes factors in the results section or the discussion section. Giving up error control also means giving up claims about the presence or absence of effects.\n\n4.3.5 Misunderstanding 5: Interpret Bayes Factors as effect sizes.\nBayes factors are not statements about the size of an effect. It is therefore not appropriate to conclude that the effect size is small or large purely based on the Bayes factor. Depending on the priors used when specifying the alternative and null model, the same Bayes factor can be observed for very different effect size estimates. The reverse is also true. The same effect size can correspond to Bayes factors supporting the null or the alternative hypothesis, depending on how the null model and the alternative model are specified. Researchers should therefore always report and interpret effect size measure. Statements about the size of effects should only be based on these effect size measures, and not on Bayes factors."

    "text": "4.4 Bayesian Estimation\nThe posterior distribution summarizes our belief about the expected number of heads when flipping a coin after seeing the data, by averaging over our prior beliefs and the data (or the likelihood). The mean of a Beta distribution can be calculated by \\(\\alpha\\)/(\\(\\alpha\\)+\\(\\beta\\)). We can thus easily calculate the mean of a posterior distribution, which is the expected value based on our prior beliefs and the data.\nWe can also calculate a credible interval around the mean, which is a Bayesian version of a confidence interval with a slightly different interpretation. Instead of the Frequentist interpretation where a parameter has one (unknown) true value, the Bayesian approach considers the data fixed, but allow the parameter to vary. In Bayesian approaches, probability distributions represent our degree of belief. When calculating a credible interval, one is saying ‘I believe it is 95% probable (given my prior and the data) that the true parameter falls within this credible interval’. A 95% credible interval is simply the area of the posterior distribution between the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles.\nA credible interval and a confidence interval are the same, when a uniform prior (e.g., Beta(1,1)) is used. In this case, credible interval is numerically identical to the confidence interval. Only the interpretation differs. Whenever an informed prior is used, the credible interval and confidence interval differ. If the chosen prior is not representative of the truth, the credible interval will not be representative of the truth, but it is always a correct formalization of your beliefs. For a single confidence interval, the probability that it contains the true population parameter is either 0 or 1. Only in the long run will 95% of confidence intervals contain the true population parameter. These are important differences between Bayesian credible intervals and Frequentist confidence intervals to keep in mind.\nWe can plot the mean for the posterior when 10 heads out of 20 coin flips are observed, given a uniform prior.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Plot for the mean of the posterior when 10 out of 20 heads are observed given a uniform prior.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also use the ‘binom’ package to calculate the posterior mean, credible interval, and highest density interval (HDI). The highest density interval is an alternative to the credible interval that works better when the posterior beta distribution is skewed (and is identical when the posterior distribution is symmetrical. We won’t go into the calculations of the HDI here.\n\nlibrary(binom)\n\nn &lt;- 20 # set total trials\nx &lt;- 10 # set successes\naprior &lt;- 1 # Set the alpha for the Beta distribution for the prior\nbprior &lt;- 1 # Set the beta for the Beta distribution for the prior\n\nbinom.bayes(x, n, type = \"central\", prior.shape1 = aprior, prior.shape2 = bprior)\nbinom.bayes(x, n, type = \"highest\", prior.shape1 = aprior, prior.shape2 = bprior)\n\n\n\n\nmethod\nx\nn\nshape1\nshape2\nmean\nlower\nupper\nsig\n\n\nbayes\n10\n20\n11\n11\n0.5\n0.2978068\n0.7021932\n0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmethod\nx\nn\nshape1\nshape2\nmean\nlower\nupper\nsig\n\n\nbayes\n10\n20\n11\n11\n0.5\n0.2978068\n0.7021932\n0.05\n\n\n\n\n\nThe posterior mean is identical to the Frequentist mean, but this is only the case when the mean of the prior equals the mean of the likelihood (Albers et al., 2018). In your research, you will most likely need other calculations than the binomial example we have used here, and a lot of Bayesian tests are now available in the free open source software package JASP. The math and the priors become more complex, but the basic idea remains the same. You can use Bayesian statistics to quantify relative evidence, which can inform you how much we should believe, or update our beliefs, in theories.\nThis chapter showed the essence of Bayesian inference, where we decide upon a prior distribution, collect data and calculate a marginal likelihood, and use these to calculate a posterior distribution. From this posterior distribution, we can estimate the mean and the 95% credible interval. For any specific hypothesis, we can calculate the relative evidence for a posterior model, compared to a prior model, through the Bayes Factor. There are many different flavors of Bayesian statistics. This means there are disagreements among Bayesians about what the best approach to statistical inferences is, which are at least as vehement as the disagreements between frequentists and Bayesians. For example, many Bayesians dislike Bayes factors (McElreath, 2016). Some Bayesians dislike subjective priors as used in subjective Bayesian analysis, and instead prefer what is known as objective Bayesian analysis (Berger & Bayarri, 2004). Teaching material on Bayesian statistics will often present it as superior to frequentist statistics. For a more balanced educational lecture on Bayesian vs. frequentist statistics that more honestly highlights the strengths and weaknesses of both approach, see the first 50 minutes of this lecture by Michael I. Jordan."

Rozeboom (1960) has criticized Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing by stating:\n\nBut the primary aim of a scientific experiment is not to precipitate decisions, but to make an appropriate adjustment in the degree to which one accepts, or believes, the hypothesis or hypotheses being tested”.\n\nFrick (1996) has argued against Rozeboom, by stating:\n\nRozeboom (1960) suggested that scientists should not be making decisions about claims, they should be calculating and updating the probability of these claims. However, this does not seem practical. If there were only a handful of potential claims in any given area of psychology, it would be feasible to assign them probabilities, to be constantly updating the probabilities, and to expect experimenters to keep track of these ever-changing probabilities. In fact, just the number of claims in psychology is overwhelming. It would probably be impossible for human beings to keep track of the probability for each claim, especially if these probabilities were constantly changing. In any case, scientists do not assign probabilities to claims. Instead, scientists act like the goal of science is to collect a corpus of claims that are considered to be established (Giere, 1972).\n\nWhen it comes to philosophy of science, there are no right or wrong answers. Reflect in 250 words on your thoughts about the two goals of science outlines by Rozeboom and Frick, and how these relate to your philosophy of science.\n\n4.5.1 Open Questions\n\nWhat is a Bayes factor?\nWhat is the difference between a Bayes factor and a likelihood ratio?\nWhat does a Bayes factor of 1 mean?\nWhat is the prior in Bayesian inference, and is it possible that different people have different priors?\nWhat is the difference between a Frequentist confidence interval and a Bayesian credible interval?\nWhat is the difference between a uniform and informed prior when we compute the posterior distribution?\nGive a definition of a credible interval.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbers, C.

    "text": "5.1 Description\nDescription aims to answer questions about features of the empirical manifestation of some phenomenon. Description can involve unique events (e.g., case studies of single patients) and classes of events (e.g., patients with a certain disease). Examples of features of interest are duration (how long), quantity (how many), location (where), etc.\nAn example of a descriptive question is research by Kinsey, who studied the sexual behavior and experiences of Americans in a time that very little scientific research was available on this topic. He used interviews that provided the statistical basis to draw conclusions about sexuality in the United States, which, at the time, challenged conventional beliefs about sexuality.\nDescriptive research questions are answered through estimation statistics. The informational value of an estimation study is determined by the amount of observations (the more observations, the higher the precision of the estimates) and the sampling plan (the more representative the sample, the lower the sample selection bias, which increases the ability to generalize from the sample to the population), and the reliability of the measure.\nDescriptive research questions are sometimes seen as less exciting than explanation or prediction questions (Gerring, 2012), but they are an essential building block of theory formation (Scheel et al., 2021). Although estimation question often focus on the mean score of a measure, accurate estimates of the variance of a measure are extremely valuable as well. The variance of a measure is essential information in a well-informed sample size justification, both when planning for accuracy, as when performing an a-priori power analysis."

    "text": "5.2 Prediction\nThe goal in predictive modeling is to apply an algorithm or a statistical model to predict future observations (Shmueli, 2010). For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic a large number of models were created that combined variables to estimate the risk that people would be infected with COVID, or that people who were infected would experience negative effects on their health (Wynants et al., 2020). Ideally, the goal is to develop a prediction model that accurately captures the regularities in its training data, and that generalizes well to unseen data. There is a bias-variance trade off between these two goals, and researchers need to decide how much bias should be reduced which increases the variance, or vice-versa (Yarkoni & Westfall, 2017). The goal in prediction is to minimize prediction error. A common method to evaluate prediction errors is cross-validation, where it is examined whether a model developed on a training dataset generalizes to a holdout dataset. The development of prediction models is becoming increasingly popular with the rise of machine learning approaches."

    "section": "\n5.3 Explanation",
    "text": "5.3 Explanation\nThe use of statistical models concerns tests of explanatory theories. In this case, statistical models are used to test causal assumptions, or explanations that we derive from theories. Meehl (1990a) reminds us of the important distinction between a substantive theory, a statistical hypothesis, and observations. Statistical inference is only involved in drawing conclusions about the statistical hypothesis. Observations can lead to the conclusion that the statistical hypothesis is confirmed (or not), but this conclusion does not directly translate into corroboration for the theory. Platt (1964) refers to the systematic application of statistical tests to accumulate knowledge as strong inference. It consists of 1) specifying alternative hypotheses, 2) designing an experiment that can corroborate one hypothesis and falsify another, and 3) performing the experiment. This cycle can be repeated to test a number of hypotheses until one hypothesis that can explain the observed data remains. Platt notes how entertaining multiple alternative hypotheses prevents researchers from becoming too attached to a single hypothesis. When designing a new experiment, researchers should ask themselves what Platt calls ‘The Question’: “But sir, what hypothesis does your experiment disprove?”.\nWe never test a theory in isolation, but always include auxiliary hypotheses about the measures and instruments that are used in a study, the conditions realized in the experiment, up to the ceteris paribus clause that assumes “all other things are equal”. The best experimental set-up can rarely by ‘deduced’ from theory, and requires premisses that are tacitly taken for granted. As Hempel (1966) states: “Reliance on auxiliary hypotheses, as we shall see, is the rule rather than the exception in the testing of scientific hypotheses; and it has an important consequence for the question whether an unfavorable test finding, i.e., one that shows I to be false, can be held to disprove the hypothesis under investigation.” Therefore, it is never clear if a failure to corroborate a theoretical prediction should be blamed on the theory or the auxiliary hypotheses. To generate reliable explanatory theories, researchers therefore have to perform lines of research in which auxiliary hypotheses are systematically tested (Uygun Tunç & Tunç, 2022).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Distinction between a theoretical hypothesis, a statistical hypothesis, and observations.

    "section": "\n5.4 Loosening and Tightening",
    "text": "5.4 Loosening and Tightening\nFor each of the three questions above, we can ask questions about description, prediction, and explanation during a loosening phase when doing research, or during a tightening phase (Fiedler, 2004). The distinction is relative. During the loosening stage, the focus is on creating variation that provides the source for new ideas. During the tightening stage, selection takes place with the goal to distinguish useful variants from less useful variants. In descriptive research, an unstructured interview is more aligned with the loosening phase, while a structured interview is more aligned with the tightening phase. In prediction, building a prediction model based on the training set is the loosening phase, while evaluation the prediction error in the holdout dataset is the tightening phase. In explanation, exploratory experimentation functions to generate hypotheses, while hypothesis tests function to distinguish theories that make predictions that are corroborated from those theories which predictions are not corroborated.\nIt is important to realize whether your goal is to generate new ideas, or to test new ideas. Researchers are often not explicit about the stage their research is in, which runs the risk of trying to test hypotheses prematurely (Scheel et al., 2021). Clinical trials research is more explicit about the different phases of research, and distinguishes Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and Phase 4 trials. In a Phase 1 trial researchers evaluate the safety of a new drug or intervention in a small group of non-randomized (often healthy) volunteers, by examining how much of a drug is safe to give, while monitoring a range of possible side effects. A phase 2 trial are often performed with patients as participants, and can focus in more detail on finding the definite dose. The goal is to systematically explore a range of parameters (e.g., the intensity of a stimulus) to identify boundary conditions (Dubin, 1969). A phase 3 trial is a large randomized controlled trial with the goal to test the effectiveness of the new intervention in practice. Phase 3 trials require a prespecified statistical analysis plan that strictly controls error rates. Finally, a Phase 4 trial examines long term safety and generalizability. Compared to a Phase 3 trial, there is more loosening, as researchers explore the possibility of interactions with other drugs, or moderating effects in certain subgroups of the population. In clinical trials, a Phase 3 trial requires a huge amount of preparation, and is not undertaken lightly.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Four phases of clinical research. Source."

    "section": "\n5.5 Three Statistical Philosophies",
    "text": "5.5 Three Statistical Philosophies\nRoyall (1997) distinguishes three questions one can ask:\n\nWhat do I believe, now that I have this observation?\nWhat should I do, now that I have this observation?\nWhat does this observation tell me about A versus B? (How should I interpret this observation as evidence regarding A versus B?)\n\nOne useful metaphor for thinking about these differences is if we look at Hinduism, where there are three ways to reach enlightenment: The Bhakti yoga, or the Path of Devotion, the Karma yoga, or the Path of Action, the Jnana yoga, or the Path of Knowledge. The three corresponding statistical paths are Bayesian statistics, which focuses on updating beliefs, Neyman-Pearson statistics, which focuses on making decisions about how to act, and likelihood approaches, which focus on quantifying the evidence or knowledge gained from the data. Just like in Hinduism the different paths are not mutually exclusive, and the emphasis on these three yoga’s differs between individuals, so will scientists differ in their emphasis of their preferred approach to statistics.\nThe three approaches to statistical modelling (description, prediction, and explanation) can be examined from each the three statistical philosophies (e.g., frequentist estimation, maximum likelihood estimation, and Bayesian estimation, or Neyman-Pearson hypothesis tests, likelihood ratio tests, and Bayes factors). Bayesian approaches start from a specified prior belief, and use the data to update their belief. Frequentist procedures focus on methodological procedures that allow researchers to make inferences that control the probability of error in the long run. Likelihood approaches focus on quantifying the evidential value in the observed data. When used knowledgeably, these approaches often yield very similar inferences (Dongen et al., 2019; Lakens et al., 2020; Tendeiro & Kiers, 2019). Jeffreys (1939), who developed a Bayesian hypothesis test, noted the following when comparing his Bayesian hypothesis test against frequentist methods proposed by Fisher:\n\nI have in fact been struck repeatedly in my own work, after being led on general principles to a solution of a problem, to find that Fisher had already grasped the essentials by some brilliant piece of common sense, and that his results would be either identical with mine or would differ only in cases where we should both be very doubtful. As a matter of fact I have applied my significance tests to numerous applications that have also been worked out by Fisher’s, and have not yet found a disagreement in the actual decisions reached.\n\nAt the same time, each approach is based on different principles, and allows for specific inferences. For example, a Neyman-Pearson approach does not quantify evidence, and a Bayesian approach can lead conclusions about the relative support for one over another hypothesis, given specified priors, while ignoring the rate at which such a conclusion would be misleading. Understanding these basic principles is useful, as criticisms on statistical practices (e.g., computing p-values) always boil down to a disagreement about the principles that different statistical philosophies are built on. However, when we survey the literature, we rarely see the viewpoint that all approaches to statistical inferences, including p values, provide answers to specific questions a researcher might want to ask. Instead, statisticians often engage in what I call the statistician’s fallacy — a declaration of what they believe researchers really “want to know” without limiting the usefulness of their preferred statistical question to a specific context (Lakens, 2021). The most well-known example of the statistician’s fallacy is provided by Cohen (1994) when discussing null-hypothesis significance testing:\n\nWhat’s wrong with NHST? Well, among many other things, it does not tell us what we want to know, and we so much want to know what we want to know that, out of desperation, we nevertheless believe that it does! What we want to know is ‘Given these data, what is the probability that H0 is true?’\n\nDifferent statisticians will argue what you actually “want to know” is the posterior probability of a hypothesis, the false-positive risk, the effect size and its confidence interval, the likelihood, the Bayes factor, or the severity with which a hypothesis has been tested. However, it is up to you to choose a statistical strategy that matches the question you want the ask (Hand, 1994)."

    "section": "\n5.6 Falsification",
    "text": "5.6 Falsification\nAs we have seen above scientists can adopt a Bayesian perspective, and try to quantify their belief in the probability that a hypothesis is true, or they can make claims based on frequentist long run probabilities that have a low probability of being an error. The falsificationist philosophy of Karl Popper is built on this second approach:\n\nInstead of discussing the ‘probability’ of a hypothesis we should try to assess what tests, what trials, it has withstood; that is, we should try to assess how far it has been able to prove its fitness to survive by standing up to tests. In brief, we should try to assess how far it has been ‘corroborated’.\n\nIt is important to distinguish dogmatic falsificationism - which Karl Popper and Imre Lakatos criticized in their philosophical work - from naïve falsificationism and sophisticated methodological falsificationism. Dogmatic falsificationism proposes a clear distinction between theory and facts, and argues that facts (observations) can falsify theories. Lakatos (1978) (p. 13) summarizes this view as: “the theoretician proposes, the experimenter - in the name of Nature - disposes”. Lakatos argues against this idea, because “there are and can be no sensations unimpregnated by expectation and therefore there is no natural (i.e. psychological) demarcation between observational and theoretical propositions.” The facts we observe are themselves influenced, at least to some extent, by our theories. Dogmatic falsificationism also argues that the truth-value of observational statements can be derived from facts alone. Popper (2002) criticized this view, and argued that our direct experiences can not logically justify statements (p. 87): “Experiences can motivate a decision, and hence an acceptance or a rejection of a statement, but a basic statement cannot be justified by them — no more than by thumping the table.” Finally, Lakatos criticizes the demarcation criterion of dogmatic falsificationists, that “only those theories are ‘scientific’ which forbid certain observable states of affairs and therefore are factually disprovable”. Instead, he argues “exactly the most admired scientific theories simply fail to forbid any observable state of affairs.” The reason for this is that theories often only make predictions in combination with a ceteris paribus clause (as discussed above), and one therefore has to decide if failed predictions should be relegated to the theory, or the ceteris paribus clause.\nWhat is the difference between dogmatic falsificationism and naïve or methodological falsificationism as proposed by Popper? First, Popper accepts there is never a strict distinction between theories and facts, but relegates the influence of theories to “unproblematic background knowledge” that is (tentatively) accepted while testing a theory. These are ‘auxiliary hypotheses’ that, according to Popper, should be used as sparingly as possible. Second, methodological falsificationism separates rejection and disproof. In methodological falsificationism the truth-value of statements is not disproven by facts, but it can be rejected based on agreed upon methodological procedures. These methodological procedures are never certain. As explained in the section on interpreting p-values, Popper argues:\n\nScience does not rest upon solid bedrock. The bold structure of its theories rises, as it were, above a swamp. It is like a building erected on piles. The piles are driven down from above into the swamp, but not down to any natural or ‘given’ base; and if we stop driving the piles deeper, it is not because we have reached firm ground. We simply stop when we are satisfied that the piles are firm enough to carry the structure, at least for the time being.\n\nIn methodological falsificationism the demarcation criterion is much more liberal than in dogmatic falsificationism. For example, probabilistic theories are now deemed ‘scientific’ because these can be made ‘falsifiable’ by “specifying certain rejection rules which may render statistically interpreted evidence ‘inconsistent’ with the probabilistic theory” (Lakatos, 1978, p. 25).\nPopper and especially Lakatos developed methodological falsification further into sophisticated falsificationism. Sophisticated methodological falsificationism stresses that science is often not simply about testing a theory in an experiment, but testing different theories or a series of theories against each other in lines of experiments. Furthermore, it acknowledges that in practice confirmation also plays an important role in deciding between competing theories. Lakatos attempted to integrate views by Thomas Kuhn (1962) on how scientific knowledge was generated in practice, but replaced Kuhn’s social and psychological processes by logical and methodological processes. In sophisticated methodological falsificationism a theory is falsified if the novel theory 1) predicts novel facts, 2) is able to explain the success of the previous theory, and 3) some of the novel predictions are corroborated. Falsification no longer occurs in single tests of predictions, but through progressive and degenerative research lines. Of course, it is difficult to know if a research line is progressing or degenerating in a short time scale. According to Meehl (2004) progressive research lines lead to theories appearing in textbooks, discussion meetings about the theory disappear from conferences, and the theory is no longer tested but mainly improved. Meehl refers to this endpoint as ‘ensconcement’ and suggests fifty-year ensconcement as a good proxy for the truth (even though some theories, as those by Newton, can take longer to be falsified). Note that scientists untrained in philosophy of science often incorrectly characterize Popper’s ideas about falsification as dogmatic falsificationism, without realizing Popper’s sophisticated methodological falsificationism was a direct criticism of dogmatic falsificationism."

According to Mayo (2018) “a claim is severely tested to the extent it has been subjected to and passed a test that probably would have found flaws, were they present.” Severe tests are not the only goal in science - after all, tautologies can be severely tested - and the aim of severe tests should be pursued together with the goal to test interesting theoretical or practical questions. But they are seen as a desireable feature, as nicely expressed by the physicist Richard Feynman (1974): “I’m talking about a specific, extra type of integrity that is not lying, but bending over backwards to show how you’re maybe wrong, that you ought to do when acting as a scientist.” The idea of severe (or ‘risky’) tests is well explained in the article “Appraising and amending theories: The strategy of Lakatosian defense and two principles that warrant it” by Paul Meehl (1990a):\n\nA theory is corroborated to the extent that we have subjected it to such risky tests; the more dangerous tests it has survived, the better corroborated it is. If I tell you that Meehl’s theory of climate predicts that it will rain sometime next April, and this turns out to be the case, you will not be much impressed with my “predictive success.” Nor will you be impressed if I predict more rain in April than in May, even showing three asterisks (for p &lt; .001) in my t-test table! If I predict from my theory that it will rain on 7 of the 30 days of April, and it rains on exactly 7, you might perk up your ears a bit, but still you would be inclined to think of this as a “lucky coincidence.” But suppose that I specify which 7 days in April it will rain and ring the bell; then you will start getting seriously interested in Meehl’s meteorological conjectures. Finally, if I tell you that on April 4th it will rain 1.7 inches (.66 cm), and on April 9th, 2.3 inches (.90 cm) and so forth, and get seven of these correct within reasonable tolerance, you will begin to think that Meehl’s theory must have a lot going for it. You may believe that Meehl’s theory of the weather, like all theories, is, when taken literally, false, since probably all theories are false in the eyes of God, but you will at least say, to use Popper’s language, that it is beginning to look as if Meehl’s theory has considerable verisimilitude, that is, “truth-likeness.”\n\nTo appreciate the concept of severe tests, it is worth reflecting on what insevere tests look like. Imagine a researcher who collects data, and after looking at which statistical tests yield a statistically significant result, thinks up a theory. What is the problem of this practice, known as hypothesizing after results are known, or HARKing (Kerr, 1998)? After all, the hypothesis this researcher comes up with could be correct! The reason that HARKing in science is problematic is that the statistical test is completely insevere: There is no way that the statistical test could have proven the claim wrong, if it was wrong. Again, the claim may be correct, but the test does not increase our confidence in this in any way. Mayo (2018) calls this: Bad Evidence, No Test (BENT). A similar problem occurs when researchers engage in questionable research practices. As these practices can substantially inflate the Type 1 error rate, they greatly increase the probability a test will corroborate a prediction, even if that prediction is wrong. Again, the severity of the test is impacted. Of course, you can use questionable research practices and reach a correct conclusion. But after p-hacking, the test has a greatly reduced capacity to prove the researcher wrong. If this lack of a severe test is not transparently communicated, readers are fooled into believing a claim has been severely tested, when it has not. These problems can be mitigated by preregistering the statistical analysis plan (Lakens, 2019)."

    "section": "\n5.8 Risky Predictions",
    "text": "5.8 Risky Predictions\nThe goal of a hypothesis test is to carefully examine whether predictions that are derived from a scientific theory hold up under scrutiny. Not all predictions we can test are equally exciting. For example, if a researcher asks two groups to report their mood on a scale from 1 to 7, and then predicts the difference between these groups will fall within a range of -6 to +6, we know in advance that it must be so. No result can falsify the prediction, and therefore finding a result that corroborates the prediction is completely trivial and a waste of time.\nThe most common division of states of the world that are predicted and that are not predicted by a theory in null-hypothesis significance testing is the following: An effect of exactly zero is not predicted by a theory, and all other effects are taken to corroborate the theoretical prediction. Here, I want to explain why this is a very weak hypothesis test. In certain lines of research, it might even be a pretty trivial prediction. It is quite easy to perform much stronger tests of hypotheses. One way would be to reduce the alpha level of a test, as this increases the probability of being proven wrong, when the prediction is wrong. But it is also possible to increase the riskiness of a test by reducing which outcomes are still considered support for the prediction.\nTake a look at the three circles below. Each circle represents all possible outcomes of an empirical test of a theory. The blue line illustrates the state of the world that was observed in a (hypothetical) perfectly accurate study. The line could have fallen anywhere on the circle. We performed a study and found one specific outcome. The black area in the circle represents the states of the world that will be interpreted as falsifying our prediction, whereas the white area illustrates the states in the world we predicted, and that will be interpreted as corroborating our prediction.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Three circles vizualizing predictions that exclude different parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\nIn the figure on the left, only a tiny fraction of states of the world will falsify our prediction. This represents a hypothesis test where only an infinitely small portion of all possible states of the world is not in line with the prediction. A common example is a two-sided null-hypothesis significance test, which forbids (and tries to reject) only the state of the world where the true effect size is exactly zero.\nIn the middle circle, 50% of all possible outcomes falsify the prediction, and 50% corroborates it. A common example is a one-sided null-hypothesis test. If you predict the mean is larger than zero, this prediction is falsified by all states of the world where the true effect is either equal to zero, or smaller than zero. This means that half of all possible states of the world can no longer be interpreted as corroborating your prediction. The blue line, or observed state of the world in the experiment, happens to fall in the white area for the middle circle, so we can still conclude the prediction is supported. However, our prediction was already slightly riskier than in the circle on the left representing a two-sided test.\nIn the scenario in the right circle, almost all possible outcomes are not in line with our prediction – only 5% of the circle is white. Again, the blue line, our observed outcome, falls in this white area, and our prediction is confirmed. However, now our prediction is confirmed in a very risky test. There were many ways in which we could be wrong – but we were right regardless.\nAlthough our prediction is confirmed in all three scenarios above, philosophers of science such as Popper and Lakatos would be most impressed after your prediction has withstood the most severe test (i.e., in the scenario illustrated by the right circle). Our prediction was most specific: 95% of possible outcomes were judged as falsifying our prediction, and only 5% of possible outcomes would be interpreted as support for our theory. Despite this high hurdle, our prediction was corroborated. Compare this to the scenario on the left – almost any outcome would have supported our theory. That our prediction was confirmed in the scenario in the left circle is hardly surprising.\nMaking more risky range predictions has some important benefits over the widespread use of null-hypothesis tests. These benefits mean that even if a null-hypothesis test is defensible, it would be preferable if you could test a range prediction. Making a more risky prediction gives your theory higher verisimilitude. You will get more credit in darts when you correctly predict you will hit the bullseye, than when you correctly predict you will hit the board. Many sports work like this, such as figure skating or gymnastics. The riskier the routine you perform, the more points you can score, since there were many ways the routine could have failed if you lacked the skill. Similarly, you get more credit for the predictive power of your theory when you correctly predict an effect will fall within 0.5 scale points of 8 on a 10 point scale, than when you predict the effect will be larger than the midpoint of the scale.\nMeehl (1967) compared the use of statistical tests in psychology and physics and notes that in physics researchers make point predictions. One way to test point predictions is to examine whether the observed mean falls between an upper and lower bound. In chapter 9 we will discuss how to perform such tests, such as equivalence tests or minimum effect tests, in practice. Although equivalence tests are often used to test whether an effect falls within a specified range around 0, and interval hypothesis test can be performed around any value, and thereby used to perform more risky tests of hypotheses.\nAlthough Meehl prefers point predictions that lie within a certain range, he doesn’t completely reject the use of null-hypothesis significance testing. When he asks ‘Is it ever correct to use null-hypothesis significance tests?’ his own answer is ‘Of course it is’ (Meehl, 1990a). There are times, such as very early in research lines, where researchers do not have good enough models, or reliable existing data, to make point or range predictions. Other times, two competing theories are not more precise than that one predicts rats in a maze will learn something, while the other theory predicts the rats will learn nothing. As Meehl (1990a) writes: “When I was a rat psychologist, I unabashedly employed significance testing in latent-learning experiments; looking back I see no reason to fault myself for having done so in the light of my present methodological views.”\nThere are no good or bad statistical approaches – all statistical approaches are provide an answer to a specific question. It makes sense to allow traditional null-hypothesis tests early in research lines, when theories do not make more specific predictions than that ‘something’ will happen. But we should also push ourselves to develop theories that make more precise range predictions, and then test these more specific predictions in interval hypothesis tests. More mature theories should be able to predict effects in some range – even when these ranges are relatively wide."

    "section": "\n5.9 Do You Really Want to Test a Hypothesis?",
    "text": "5.9 Do You Really Want to Test a Hypothesis?\n\n\n\nA hypothesis test is a very specific answer to a very specific question. We can use a dart game as a metaphor for the question a hypothesis test aims to answer. In essence, both a dart game and a hypothesis test are a methodological procedure to make a directional prediction: Is A better or worse than B? In a dart game we very often compare two players, and the question is whether we should act as if player A is the best, or player B is the best. In a hypothesis test, we compare two hypotheses, and the question is whether we should act as if the null hypothesis is true, or whether the alternative hypothesis is true.\nHistorically, researchers have often been interested in testing hypotheses to examine whether predictions that are derived from a scientific theory hold up under scrutiny. Some philosophies of science (but not all) value theories that are able to make predictions. If a darter wants to convince you they are a good player, they can make a prediction (‘the next arrow will hit the bulls-eye’), throw a dart, and impress you by hitting the bulls-eye. When a researcher uses a theory to make a prediction, collects data, and observes can claim based on a predefined methodological procedure that the results confirm their prediction, the idea is you are impressed by the predictive validity of a theory (de Groot, 1969). The test supports the idea that the theory is a useful starting point to generate predictions about reality. Philosophers of science such as Popper call this ‘verisimilitude’– the theory is in some way related to the truth, and it has some ‘truth-likeness’.\nIn order to be impressed when a prediction is confirmed, the prediction must be able to be wrong. In other words, a theoretical prediction needs to be falsifiable. If our predictions concern the presence or absence of clearly observable entities (e.g., the existence of a black swan) it is relatively straightforward to divide all possible states of the world into a set that is predicted by our theory (e.g., all swans are white), and a set that is not predicted by our theory (e.g., swans can have other colors than white). However, many scientific questions concern probabilistic events where single observations contain noise due to random variation – rats have a certain probability to develop a tumor, people have a certain probability to buy a product, or particles have a certain probability to appear after a collision. If we want to forbid certain outcomes of our test when measuring probabilistic events, we can divide the states of the world based on the probability that some result will be observed.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Some fields make black and white predictions about the presence or absence of observables, but in many sciences, predictions are probabilistic, and shades of grey.\n\n\n\n\nJust because a hypothesis test can be performed, does not mean it is interesting. A hypothesis test is most useful when 1) both data generating models that are decided between have some plausibility, and 2) it is possible to apply an informative methodological procedure.\nFirst, the two competing models should both be good players. Just as in a dart game there would be very little interest if I played Michael van Gerwen (the world champion at the time of writing) to decide who the better dart player is. Since I do not play darts very well, a game between the two of us would not be interesting to watch. Similarly, it is sometimes completely uninteresting to compare two data generating models, one representing the state of the world when there is no effect, and another representing the state of the world when there is some effect, because in some cases the absence of an effect is extremely implausible.\nSecond, for a hypothesis test to be interesting you need to have designed an informative study. When designing a study, you need to be able to make sure that the methodological rule provides a severe test, where you are likely to corroborate a prediction if it is correct, while at the same time fail to corroborate a prediction when it is wrong (Mayo, 2018). If the world champion in darts and I stand 20 inches away from a dart board and can just push the dart in the location where we want it to end up, it is not possible to show my lack of skill. If we are both are blindfolded and throwing the darts from 100 feet, it is not possible for the world champion to display their skill. In a hypothesis test, the statistical severity of a test is determined by the error rates. Therefore, a researcher needs to be able to adequately control error rates to perform a test of a hypothesis with high informational value.\nBy now it is hopefully clear that hypothesis tests are a very specific tool, that answer a very specific question: After applying a methodological rule to observed data, which decision should I make if I do not want to make incorrect decisions too often? If you have no desire to use a methodological procedure to decide between competing theories, there is no real reason to report the results of a hypothesis test. Even though it might feel like you should test a hypothesis when doing research, carefully thinking about the statistical question you want to ask might reveal that alternative statistical approaches, such as describing the data you have observed, quantifying your personal beliefs about hypotheses, or reporting the relative likelihood of data under different hypotheses might be the approach that answers the question you really want to know."

    "section": "\n5.10 Directional (One-Sided) versus Non-Directional (Two-Sided) Tests",
    "text": "5.10 Directional (One-Sided) versus Non-Directional (Two-Sided) Tests\nAs explained above, one way to increase the riskiness of a prediction is by performing a directional test. Interestingly, there is quite some disagreement about whether the statistical question you ask in a study should be directional (meaning that only effects in a predicted direction will lead to rejection of the null hypothesis) or non-directional (meaning that effects in either direction will lead to the rejection of the null-hypothesis). For example, Baguley (2012) writes “one-sided tests should typically be avoided” because researchers are rarely willing to claim an effect in the non-predicted direction is non-significant, regardless of how large it is. At the same time, Jones (1952) has stated: “Since the test of the null hypothesis against a one-sided alternative is the most powerful test for all directional hypotheses, it is strongly recommended that the one-tailed model be adopted wherever its use is appropriate”, and Cho & Abe (2013) complain about the “widespread overuse of two-tailed testing for directional research hypotheses tests”. Let’s reflect on some arguments for or against the choice to perform a one-sided test.\nFirst, it is clear that a directional test provides a clear advantage in statistical power. As Figure 5.5 shows, the ratio of the sample for a non-directional versus a directional test means that approximately 80% of the sample size of a non-directional test is required to achieve the same power in a directional test (the exact benefit depends on the power and effect size, as seen in the figure below).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Ratio of the required sample size for a one-sample t-test for a non-directional/directional test to achieve 50%, 80% or 95% power.\n\n\n\n\nBecause in a directional test the alpha level is used for only one tail of the distribution, the critical test value is lower, and all else equal, power is higher. This reduction of the critical value required to declare a statistically significant effect has been criticized because it leads to weaker evidence. For example, Schulz & Grimes (2005) write: “Using a one-sided test in sample size calculations to reduce required sample sizes stretches credulity.”. This is trivially true: Any change to the design of a study that requires a smaller sample size reduces the strength of the evidence you collect, since the strength of evidence is inherently tied to the total number of observations. However, it conflates two types of statistical philosophies, namely a likelihoodist approach, which aims to quantify relative evidence, and a frequentist approach, which aims to provide a procedure to make claims with a maximum error rate. There is a difference between designing a study that yields a certain level of evidence, and a study that adequately controls the error rates when performing a hypothesis test. If you desire a specific level of evidence, design a study that provides this desired level of evidence. If you desire to control the error rate of claims, then that error rate is at most 5% as long as the alpha level is 5%, regardless of whether a one-sided or two-sided test is performed.\nNote that there is a subtle distinction between a directional and a one-sided test (Baguley, 2012). Although the two terms overlap when performing a t-test, they do not overlap for an F-test. The F-value and the t-value are related: \\(t^2 = F\\). This holds as long as the df1 = 1 (e.g., F(1, 100), or in other words as long as only two groups are compared. We can see in Figure 5.6 that the two distributions touch at t = 1 (as 1^2 = 1), and that the F-test has no negative values due to the squared nature of the distribution. The critical t-value, squared, of a non-directional t-test with a 5% error rate equals the critical F-value for an F-test, which is always one-sided, with a 5% error rate. Due to the ‘squared’ nature of an F-test, an F-test is always non-directional. You can logically not halve the p-value in an F-test to perform a ‘one-sided’ test, because you can’t have a directional F-test. When comparing two groups, you can use a t-test instead of an F-test, which can be directional.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Distribution and rejection areas for a two-sided t-test and the corresponding F-test with df1 = 1 and df2 = 100.\n\n\n\n\nA final concern raised against one-sided tests is that surprising findings in the opposite direction might be meaningful, and should not be ignored. I agree, but this is not an argument against one-sided testing. The goal in hypothesis testing is, not surprisingly, to test a hypothesis. If you have a directional hypothesis, a result in the opposite direction can never confirm your hypothesis. It can lead one to create a new hypothesis, but this new hypothesis should be tested on a new dataset (de Groot, 1969). It makes sense to describe an unexpected effect in the opposite direction of your prediction, but there is a difference between describing data, and testing a hypothesis. A one-sided hypothesis test does not prohibit researchers from describing unexpected data patterns. And if you really want to test if there is an effect in either direction, simply preregister a two-sided test."

    "section": "\n5.11 Systematic Noise, or the Crud Factor",
    "text": "5.11 Systematic Noise, or the Crud Factor\nMeehl (1978) believes “the almost universal reliance on merely refuting the null hypothesis as the standard method for corroborating substantive theories in the soft areas is a terrible mistake, is basically unsound, poor scientific strategy, and one of the worst things that ever happened in the history of psychology”. At the same time, he also wrote: “When I was a rat psychologist, I unabashedly employed significance testing in latent-learning experiments; looking back I see no reason to fault myself for having done so in the light of my present methodological views” (Meehl, 1990a). When he asks ‘Is it ever correct to use null-hypothesis significance tests?’ his own answer is:\n\nOf course it is. I do not say significance testing is never appropriate or helpful; there are several contexts in which I would incline to criticize a researcher who failed to test for significance.\n\nMeehl is not of the opinion that null hypothesis significance tests are not useful at all, but that the question if any difference from zero exists is sometimes not a very interesting question to ask. Crucially, Meehl is especially worried about the widespread use of null hypothesis significance tests where there is room for systematic noise, or the crud factor in the data that are analyzed. The presence of systematic noise in data means that it is extremely unlikely that the null hypothesis is true, and combined with a large enough dataset, the question whether the null hypothesis can be rejected is uninteresting.\nSystematic noise can only be excluded in an ideal experiment. In this ideal experiment, only one single factor can lead to an effect, such as in a perfect randomized controlled trial. Perfection is notoriously difficult to achieve in practice. In any not perfect experiment, there can be tiny causal factors that, although not being the main goal of the experiment, lead to differences between the experimental and control condition. Participants in the experimental condition might read more words, answer more questions, need more time, have to think more deeply, or process more novel information. Any of these things could slightly move the true effect size away from zero – without being related to the independent variable the researchers aimed to manipulate. The difference is reliable, but not caused by anything the researcher is theoretically interested in. In real life, experiments are not even close to perfect. Consequently, there is always some room for systematic noise, although there is no way to know how large this systematic noise is in any specific study.\nSystematic noise is especially a problem in studies where there is no randomization, such as in correlational studies. As an example of correlational data, think about research that examines differences between women and men. In such a study the subjects cannot be randomly assigned to each condition. In such non-experimental studies, it is possible that ‘everything is correlated to everything’. Or slightly more formally, crud can be defined as the epistemological concept that, in correlational research, all variables are connected through multivariate causal structures which result in real non-zero correlations between all variables in any given dataset (Orben & Lakens, 2020). For example, men are on average taller than women, and as a consequence men will be asked by strangers to pick an object from a high shelf in a supermarket a bit more often tham women. If we ask men and women ‘how often do you help strangers’ this average difference in height has some tiny but systematic effect on their responses, even though a researcher might be theoretically interested in differences unrelated to height. In this specific case, systematic noise moves the mean difference from zero to a slightly higher value for men – but an unknown number of other sources of systematic noise are at play, and these all interact, leading to an unknown final true population difference that is very unlikely to be exactly zero.\nAs a consequence, some scientific fields find tests of correlations relatively uninteresting. Researchers in these fields might find it interesting to estimate the size of correlations, but they might not find it worthwhile to perform a null hypothesis significance test for a correlation, as with a large enough dataset, statistical significance is practically guaranteed. This is increasingly true, the bigger the dataset. As an anecdote, while working on a paper on sequential analysis, I asked my collaborator Prof. Wassmer why the rpact package did not have a module for tests of correlations. He replied that there was not enough interest in null hypothesis significance tests for correlations in biopharmaceutical statistics, because as everything correlates with everything anyway, why would anyone want to test it?\nWhen you perform a nil null hypothesis test, you should justify why the nil null hypothesis is an interesting hypothesis to test against. This is not always self-evident, and sometimes the nil null hypothesis is simply not very interesting. Is it plausible that the nil null hypothesis is true? If not, then it is more interesting to perform a minimal effect test. For a concrete example of how to determine if the presence of crud warrants the use of minimal effect tests in a literature, see Ferguson & Heene (2021).\nSeveral Many Lab Registered Replication Reports in psychology, where randomized experiments with very large sample sizes are performed that revisit published findings, have shown that for for all practical purposes, and given the sample sizes psychologists are able to collect, it has proven surprisingly difficult to find significant effects. A multilab replication study examining the action-sentence compatibility effect showed an average effect on the logarithm of the lift-off times close to 0 [-0.006, 0.004] in 903 native English speakers (Morey et al., 2021). A Registered Replication Report examining the effect of priming participants with either professor or hooligan related concepts yielded a non-significant difference in the number of general knowledge questions answered of a difference of 0.14% [−0.71%, 1.00%] in a sample of 4493 participants (O’Donnell et al., 2018). A Registered Replication Report examining the effect of recalling the ten commandments or 10 books read in highschool on how often people cheated on a problem-solving task showed a non-significant difference of 0.11 [-0.09; 0.31] matrices in a sample of 4674 participants (Verschuere et al., 2018). A Registered Replication Report testing the facial feedback hypothesis showed a non-significant effect on funniness ratings between conditions where participants were manipulated to move muscles related to smiling or pouting of 0.03 [−0.11; 0.16] scale units in a sample of 1894 participants (Wagenmakers et al., 2016). A multi-lab replication study of the ego-depletion effect (which will feature more prominently in the chapter on bias) observed an effect of d = 0.04 [−0.07, 0.15] in a sample of 2141 participants (Hagger et al., 2016). These studies suggest that sometimes the nil null hypothesis is a plausible model to test against, and that even with sample sizes much larger than are typically collected in psychological research, the nil null is surprisingly difficult to reject.\nOther multi-lab studies provide indications of tiny true effects, which could be due to the crud factor. Colling et al. (2020) observed congruency effects in the attentional SNARC effect for four inter-stimulus interval conditions (250, 500, 750, and 1000 ms) of -0.05 ms [-0.82l; 0.71], 1.06 ms [0.34; 1.78], 0.19 ms [-0.53; 0.90], and 0.18 ms [-0.51; 0.88] with a sample size of 1105 participants. For the statistically significant effect in the 500 ms ISI condition (which might be crud) they conclude: “we view a difference of about 1 ms, even if “real,” as too small for any neurally or psychologically plausible mechanism—particularly one constrained to operate only within a narrow time window of 500 ms after the stimulus.” McCarthy et al. (2018) observed a difference of 0.08 [0.004; 0.16] in how hostile ambiguous behavior in a vignette was rated after a priming task where more or less words were related to hostility, and conclude “Our results suggest that the procedures we used in this replication study are unlikely to produce an assimilative priming effect that researchers could practically and routinely detect.” In these instances, the null-hypothesis can be rejected, but the observed effect size is deemed too small to matter. As discussed in the chapter on equivalence testing and interval hypotheses, the solution to this problem is to specify a smallest effect size of interest."

    "section": "\n5.12 Dealing with Inconsistencies in Science",
    "text": "5.12 Dealing with Inconsistencies in Science\nWe might prefer clear answers from scientific research, but in practice we are often presented with inconsistent results in a scientific literature. What should we do when ‘even scientists can’t agree’?\nAccording to Karl Popper the ability of scientists to reach consensus about basic statements is key criteria of science:\n\nIf some day it should no longer be possible for scientific observers to reach agreement about basic statements this would amount to a failure of language as a means of universal communication. It would amount to a new ‘Babel of Tongues’: scientific discovery would be reduced to absurdity. In this new Babel, the soaring edifice of science would soon lie in ruins.\n\nOther philosophers of science, such as Thomas Kuhn, viewed different paradigms in science as incommensurable. Because research Kuhn believed paradigms change dramatically over time (which he calls scientific revolutions) advocates of competing theories can not directly compare and discuss their theories (Kuhn, 1962). Kuhn acknowledges that scientists do reach consensus within a particular research tradition (which he calls ‘normal science’):\n\nMen whose research is based on shared paradigms are committed to the same rules and standards for scientific practice. That commitment and the apparent consensus it produces are prerequisites for normal science, i.e., for the genesis and continuation of a particular research tradition.\n\nHarry Laudan aims to resolve these different views on whether scientists can or can not reach consensus by distinguishing disagreements on three levels (Laudan, 1986). The first level involves claims about theoretical or observable entities, where scientists can have factual disagreements or factual consensus. These can be resolved by methodological rules. However, scientists can also have disagreements about which methods or procedures should be used. These disagreements on the methodological level can only be resolve by discussing the aims of science, as the methods we use should be optimal techniques to achieve our aims in science. Laudan calls this the axiological level. According to Laudan, there is a mutual justification process between these three levels, and even though there are different aims, methods, and theories, scientists need to be able to justify how their approach is coherent.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: The interrelationship between the methdological level, theories that explain factual observation, and the aims of science according to Laudan’s reticulated model of scientific rationality.\n\n\n\n\nFactual inconsistencies can emerge in different ways. First, the support for a specific scientific claim can be mixed, in that some studies show statistically significant results (p &lt; .05), while other studies do not (p &gt; 0.05). We have seen that mixed results are expected in sets of studies. It is possible (and sometimes likely) that the statistical power of studies is low. If 60% of studies yield p &lt; .05 and 40% of studies yield p &gt; .05 this might seem inconsistent, but in reality the pattern of results would be perfectly consistent with the expected long run Type 2 error rates in a set of studies with low statistical power. We will see later that combining all studies in a meta-analysis can yield more clarity when individual studies have low statistical power.\nAs Popper (2002) writes: “a few stray basic statements contradicting a theory will hardly induce us to reject it as falsified. We shall take it as falsified only if we discover a reproducible effect which refutes the theory.” Remember that any claim of rejecting or accepting a hypothesis is done with a certain error rate, and that close replication studies are the only way to distinguish erroneous from correct dichotomous claims in statistical hypothesis tests. If the null hypothesis is true, the alpha level determines how many false positive results will be observed. Again, these errors should occur as often as the Type 1 error rate a study was designed to have. In a two-sided test performed with an alpha level of 5%, 2.5% of all studies will lead to a claim about an effect in the positive direction, and 2.5% of the studies will lead to a claim about an effect in the negative direction (when in reality the null hypothesis is true). Seeing statistically significant effects in the literature in both the positive and negative direction might seem inconsistent, but if all these findings are Type 1 errors, they should occur exactly as often as expected based on the chosen alpha level.\nEven if there is a true effect, just because of random variation it is possible to very rarely observe a statistically significant effect in the opposite direction, which has been called an ‘error of the third kind’ (Kaiser, 1960) or a Type S error (Altoè et al., 2020; Gelman & Carlin, 2014). Although such results are rare, you are much more likely to hear about them because a newspaper article that reads ‘as opposed to what researchers believed for the last decades, a new study suggests that spending less time studying might lead to better exam results’ makes for a very attention-grabbing headline. Because there is a real risk that counter-intuitive findings are actually just flukes, it would be good if science journalists spent more time reporting on meta-analyses, and less time reporting on surprising novel findings.\nIf all research results are transparently reported, multiple studies should quickly indicate whether we were dealing with a relatively rare Type 1 error, or a true finding. However, as we will see in the chapter on bias not all research findings are shared. As explained in the section on the positive predictive value this can lead to a literature where many Type 1 errors are published, which makes it difficult to determine if there is a true effect or not. The combination of random variation and bias in the scientific literature can make it easy to find a single study that can be used to support any viewpoint or argument. To prevent confirmation bias, you should actively search for studies that contradict the point you want to make, and evaluate the evidence across multiple studies. If this larger literature shows inconsistencies, bias detection tests might provide a first indication that the cause of the inconsistency is a biased literature. To resolve inconsistencies due to bias in the literature new studies should be performed - preferably Registered Reports that have a preregistered statistical analysis plan and are published regardless of whether results are significant or not.\nA second type of inconsistency occurs when two conflicting claims have been supported by an unbiased literature. In this case, different researchers might argue that one or the other claim is true, but it is most likely that both are false, as both are only true under specific conditions. One might argue that in some research fields, like psychology, there are always some conditions under which a claim is true, and some conditions under which the same claim is false. Indeed, if one wanted to summarize all knowledge generated by psychologists in two words, it would be “it depends”. McGuire (2004) refers to this as ‘perspectivism’, and proposed it as a fruitful approach when theorizing: “all hypotheses, even pairs of contraries, are true (at least from some perspective).” Thinking in advance about when a prediction might hold and when not is a good approach to theorize about boundary conditions and other types of moderators. If two conflicting claims have received reliable support, the presence of a moderator means that a statistical relationship between two variables depends on a third variable. In Figure 5.8 we see that the effect of X and Y depends on the level of Z (Z impacts the relationship between X and Y). For example, an effect of winning the lottery on how happy you are depends on whether your friends and family are happy for you (let’s call this condition Z = 0), or whether arguments about money ruin your personal relationships (Z = 1). The effect (indicated as a and b) might be positive in one condition of Z, and absent or even negative in another condition of Z. As there are many possible moderators, and studying moderation effects typically requires more resources than studying main effects, it is possible there is relatively little empirical research that examines moderators, in which case inconsistencies remain unresolved.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8: Path model of a moderation effect where the effect of X on Y depends on Z, where the effect sizes a and b differ from each other depending on the level of Z.\n\n\n\n\nSome researchers strongly believe failures to replicate published findings can be explained by the presence of hitherto unidentified, or ‘hidden’, moderators (Stroebe & Strack, 2014). There has been at least one example of researchers who were able to provide modest support for the idea that a previous failure to replicate a finding was due to how personally relevant a message in the study was (Luttrell et al., 2017). It is difficult to reliably identify moderator variables that explain failures to replicate published findings, but easy to raise them as an explanation when replication studies do not observe the same effect as the original study. Especially in the social sciences it is easy to point to moderators that are practically impossible to test, such as the fact that society has changed over time, or that effects that work in one culture might not replicate in different cultures. This is an age-old problem, already identified by Galileo in The Assayer, one of the first books on the scientific method. In this book, Galileo discusses the claim that Babylonians cooked eggs by whirling them in a sling, which is impossible to replicate, and writes:\n\n‘If we do not achieve an effect which others formerly achieved, it must be that we lack something in our operation which was the cause of this effect succeeding, and if we lack one thing only, then this alone can be the true cause. Now we do not lack eggs, or slings, or sturdy fellows to whirl them, and still they do not cook, but rather cool down faster if hot. And since we lack nothing except being Babylonians, then being Babylonian is the cause of the egg hardening.’\n\nResolving inconsistencies in science is an effortful process that can be facilitated by engaging in an adversarial collaboration, where two teams join forces to resolve inconsistencies (Mellers et al., 2001). It requires first establishing a reliable empirical basis by reducing the probability of Type 1 and Type 2 errors and bias, and then systematically testing hypotheses that are proposed to explain inconsistencies (Uygun Tunç & Tunç, 2022)."

    "text": "5.13 Verisimilitude and Progress in Science\nDoes science offer a way to learn what is true about our world? According to the perspective in philosophy of science known as scientific realism, the answer is ‘yes’. Scientific realism is the idea that successful scientific theories that have made novel predictions give us a good reason to believe these theories make statements about the world that are at least partially true. Known as the no miracle argument, only realism can explain the success of science, which consists of repeatedly making successful predictions (Duhem, 1954), without requiring us to believe in miracles.\nNot everyone thinks that it matters whether scientific theories make true statements about the world, as scientific realists do. Laudan (1981) argues against scientific realism based on a pessimistic meta-induction: If theories that were deemed successful in the past turn out to be false, then we can reasonably expect all our current successful theories to be false as well. Van Fraassen (1980) believes it is sufficient for a theory to be ‘empirically adequate’, and make true predictions about things we can observe, irrespective of whether these predictions are derived from a theory that describes how the unobservable world is in reality. This viewpoint is known as constructive empiricism. As Van Fraassen summarizes the constructive empiricist perspective (1980, p.12): “Science aims to give us theories which are empirically adequate; and acceptance of a theory involves as belief only that it is empirically adequate”.\nThe idea that we should ‘believe’ scientific hypotheses is not something scientific realists can get behind. Either they think theories make true statements about things in the world, but we will have to remain completely agnostic about when they do (Feyerabend, 1993), or they think that corroborating novel and risky predictions makes it reasonable to believe that a theory has some ‘truth-likeness’, or verisimilitude. The concept of verisimilitude is based on the intuition that a theory is closer to a true statement when the theory allows us to make more true predictions, and less false predictions. When data is in line with predictions, a theory gains verisimilitude, when data are not in line with predictions, a theory loses verisimilitude (Meehl, 1978). Popper clearly intended verisimilitude to be different from belief (Niiniluoto, 1998). Importantly, verisimilitude refers to how close a theory is to the truth, which makes it an ontological, not epistemological question. That is, verisimilitude is a function of the degree to which a theory is similar to the truth, but it is not a function of the degree of belief in, or the evidence for, a theory (Meehl, 1978, 1990a). It is also not necessary for a scientific realist that we ever know what is true – we just need to be of the opinion that we can move closer to the truth (known as comparative scientific realism, Kuipers (2016)).\nAttempts to formalize verisimilitude have been a challenge, and from the perspective of an empirical scientist, the abstract nature of this ongoing discussion does not really make me optimistic it will be extremely useful in everyday practice. On a more intuitive level, verisimilitude can be regarded as the extent to which a theory makes the most correct (and least incorrect) statements about specific features in the world. One way to think about this is using the ‘possible worlds’ approach (Niiniluoto, 1999), where for each basic state of the world one can predict, there is a possible world that contains each unique combination of states.\nFor example, consider the experiments by Stroop (1935), where color related words (e.g., RED, BLUE) are printed either in congruent colors (i.e., the word RED in red ink) or incongruent colors (i.e., the word RED in blue ink). We might have a very simple theory predicting that people automatically process irrelevant information in a task. When we do two versions of a Stroop experiment, one where people are asked to read the words, and one where people are asked to name the colors, this simple theory would predict slower responses on incongruent trials, compared to congruent trials. A slightly more advanced theory predicts that congruency effects are dependent upon the salience of the word dimension and color dimension (Melara & Algom, 2003). Because in the standard Stroop experiment the word dimension is much more salient in both tasks than the color dimension, this theory predicts slower responses on incongruent trials, but only in the color naming condition. We have four possible worlds, two of which represent predictions from either of the two theories, and two that are not in line with either theory.\n\n\n\nResponses Color Naming\nResponses Word Naming\n\n\n\nWorld 1\nSlower\nSlower\n\n\nWorld 2\nSlower\nNot Slower\n\n\nWorld 3\nNot Slower\nSlower\n\n\nWorld 4\nNot Slower\nNot Slower\n\n\n\nMeehl (1990b) discusses a ‘box score’ of the number of successfully predicted features, which he acknowledges is too simplistic. No widely accepted formalized measure of verisimilitude is available to express the similarity between the successfully predicted features by a theory, although several proposals have been put forward (Cevolani et al., 2011; Niiniluoto, 1998; Oddie, 2013). However, even if formal measures of verisimilitude are not available, it remains a useful concept to describe theories that are assumed to be closer to the truth because they make novel predictions (Psillos, 1999).\n\n\n\n\n\nAltoè, G., Bertoldo, G., Zandonella Callegher, C., Toffalini, E., Calcagnì, A., Finos, L., & Pastore, M.

    "text": "6.1 Effect sizes\nWhat is the most important outcome of an empirical study? You might be tempted to say it’s the p-value of the statistical test, given that it is practically always reported in articles, and determines whether we call something ‘significant’ or not. However, as Cohen (1990) writes in his ‘Things I’ve learned (so far)’:\n\nI have learned and taught that the primary product of a research inquiry is one or more measures of effect size, not p-values.\n\nAlthough what you want to learn from your data is different in every study, and there rarely is any single thing you always want to know, effect sizes are a very important part of the information we gain from data collection.\nA measure of effect size is a “quantitative reflection of the magnitude of some phenomenon that is used for the purpose of addressing a question of interest” (Kelley & Preacher, 2012). It is expressed as a number on a scale, and which scale is used depends on the effect size measure that is used. For unstandardized effect sizes, we can use a scale that people are very familiar with. For example, children grow on average 6 centimeters a year between the age of 2 and puberty. We can interpret 6 centimeters a year as an effect size. It is obvious an effect size has many benefits over a p-value. A p-value gives an indication that it is very unlikely children stay the same size as they become older – effect sizes tell us what size clothes we can expect children to wear when they are a certain age, and how long it will take before their new clothes are too small.\nOne reason to report effect sizes is to facilitate future research. It is possible to perform a meta-analysis or a power analysis based on unstandardized effect sizes and their standard deviation, but it is easier to work with standardized effect sizes, especially when there is variation in the measures researchers use. But the main goal of reporting effect sizes is to reflect on the question whether the observed effect size is meaningful. For example, we might be able to reliably measure that on average 19 years olds will grow 1 centimeter in the next year. This difference would be statistically significant in a large enough sample, but if you go shopping for clothes when you are 19 years old, it is not something you need care about. Let’s look at two examples of studies where looking at the effect size, in addition to its statistical significance, would have improved the statistical inferences."

    "section": "\n6.2 The Facebook experiment",
    "text": "6.2 The Facebook experiment\nIn the summer of 2014 there were some concerns about an experiment Facebook had performed on its users to examine ‘emotional mood contagion’, or the idea that people’s moods can be influenced by the mood of people around them. You can read the article here. For starters, there was substantial concern about the ethical aspects of the study, primarily because the researchers who performed the study had not asked for informed consent from the participants in the study (you and me), nor did they ask for permission from the institutional review board (or ethics committee) of their university.\nOne of the other criticisms of the study was that it could be dangerous to influence people’s mood. As Nancy J. Smyth, dean of the University of Buffalo’s School of Social Work wrote on her Social Work blog: “There might even have been increased self-harm episodes, out of control anger, or dare I say it, suicide attempts or suicides that resulted from the experimental manipulation. Did this experiment create harm? The problem is, we will never know, because the protections for human subjects were never put into place”.\nIf this Facebook experiment had such a strong effect on people’s mood that it made some people commit suicide who would otherwise not have committed suicide, this would obviously be problematic. So let us look at the effects the manipulation Facebook used had on people a bit more closely.\nFrom the article, let’s see what the researchers manipulated:\n\nTwo parallel experiments were conducted for positive and negative emotion: One in which exposure to friends’ positive emotional content in their News Feed was reduced, and one in which exposure to negative emotional content in their News Feed was reduced. In these conditions, when a person loaded their News Feed, posts that contained emotional content of the relevant emotional valence, each emotional post had between a 10% and 90% chance (based on their User ID) of being omitted from their News Feed for that specific viewing.\n\nThen what they measured:\n\nFor each experiment, two dependent variables were examined pertaining to emotionality expressed in people’s own status updates: the percentage of all words produced by a given person that was either positive or negative during the experimental period. In total, over 3 million posts were analyzed, containing over 122 million words, 4 million of which were positive (3.6%) and 1.8 million negative (1.6%).\n\nAnd then what they found:\n\nWhen positive posts were reduced in the News Feed, the percentage of positive words in people’s status updates decreased by B = −0.1% compared with control [t(310,044) = −5.63, P &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.02], whereas the percentage of words that were negative increased by B = 0.04% (t = 2.71, P = 0.007, d = 0.001). Conversely, when negative posts were reduced, the percent of words that were negative decreased by B = −0.07% [t(310,541) = −5.51, P &lt; 0.001, d = 0.02] and the percentage of words that were positive, conversely, increased by B = 0.06% (t = 2.19, P &lt; 0.003, d = 0.008).\n\nHere, we will focus on the negative effects of the Facebook study (so specifically, the increase in negative words people used) to get an idea of whether there is a risk of an increase in suicide rates. Even though apparently there was a negative effect, it is not easy to get an understanding about the size of the effect from the numbers as mentioned in the text. Moreover, the number of posts that the researchers analyzed was really large. With a large sample, it becomes important to check if the size of the effect is such that the finding is substantially interesting, because with large sample sizes even minute differences will turn out to be statistically significant (we will look at this in more detail below). For that, we need a better understanding of “effect sizes”."

Circled points indicate the first decision in each of the three decision sessions; tick marks on x axis denote every third case; dotted line denotes food break. From Danziger, S., Levav, J., Avnaim-Pesso, L. (2011). Extraneous factors in judicial decisions. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 108(17), 6889–6892. https://doi.org/10.1073/PNAS.1018033108\n\n\n\n\nWe see a graphical representation of the proportion of favorable parole decisions that real-life judges are making as a function of the number of cases they process across the day in Figure 6.1. This study is mentioned in many popular science books as an example of a finding that shows that people do not always make rational decisions, but that “judicial rulings can be swayed by extraneous variables that should have no bearing on legal decisions” (Danziger et al., 2011). We see that early on in the day, judges start by giving about 65% of people parole, which basically means, “All right, you can go back into society.” But then very quickly, the number of favorable decisions decreases to basically zero. After a quick break which, as the authors say, “may replenish mental resources by providing rest, improving mood, or by increasing glucose levels in the body” the parole decisions are back up at 65%, and then again quickly drop down to basically zero. They take another break, the percentage of positive decisions is back up to 65%, only to drop again over the course of the day.\nIf we calculate the effect size for the drop after a break, and before the next break (Glöckner, 2016), the effect represents a Cohen’s d of approximately two, which is incredibly large. There are hardly any effects in psychology this large, let alone effects of mood or rest on decision making. And this surprisingly large effect occurs not just once, but three times over the course of the day. If mental depletion actually has such a huge real-life impact, society would basically fall into complete chaos just before lunch break every day. Or at the very least, our society would have organized itself around this incredibly strong effect of mental depletion. Just like manufacturers take size differences between men and women into account when producing items such as golf clubs or watches, we would stop teaching in the time before lunch, doctors would not schedule surgery, and driving before lunch would be illegal. If a psychological effect is this big, we don’t need to discover it and publish it in a scientific journal - you would already know it exists.\nWe can look at a meta-meta-analysis (a paper that meta-analyzes a large number of meta-analyses in the literature) by Richard, Bond, & Stokes-Zoota (2003) to see which effect sizes in law psychology are close to a Cohen’s d of 2. They report two meta-analyzed effects that are slightly smaller. The first is the effect that a jury’s final verdict is likely to be the verdict a majority initially favored, which 13 studies show has an effect size of r = 0.63, or d = 1.62. The second is that when a jury is initially split on a verdict, its final verdict is likely to be lenient, which 13 studies show to have an effect size of r = .63 as well. In their entire database, some effect sizes that come close to d = 2 are the finding that personality traits are stable over time (r = 0.66, d = 1.76), people who deviate from a group are rejected from that group (r = .6, d = 1.5), or that leaders have charisma (r = .62, d = 1.58). You might notice the almost tautological nature of these effects. And that is, supposedly, the effect size that the passing of time (and subsequently eating lunch) has on parole hearing sentencings.\nWe see how examining the size of an effect can lead us to identify findings that cannot be caused by their proposed mechanisms. The effect reported in the hungry judges study must therefore be due to a confound. Indeed, such confounds have been identified, as it turns out the ordering of the cases is not random, and it is likely the cases that deserve parole are handled first, and the cases that do not deserve parole are handled later (Chatziathanasiou, 2022; Weinshall-Margel & Shapard, 2011). An additional use of effect sizes is to identify effect sizes that are too large to be plausible. Hilgard (2021) proposes to build in ‘maximum positive controls’, experimental conditions that show the largest possible effect that provides an upper limit on plausible effect size measures."

    "section": "\n6.4 Standardised Mean Differences",
    "text": "6.4 Standardised Mean Differences\nEffect sizes can be grouped into two families (Rosenthal et al., 2000): The d family (based on standardized mean differences) and the r family (based on measures of strength of association). Conceptually, the d family effect sizes are based on a comparison between the difference between the observations, divided by the standard deviation of these observations. This means that a Cohen’s d = 1 means the standardized difference between two groups equals one standard deviation. The size of the effect in the Facebook study above was quantified with Cohen’s d. Cohen’s d (the d is italicized) is used to describe the standardized mean difference of an effect. This value can be used to compare effects across studies, even when the dependent variables are measured with different scales, for example when one study uses 7-point scales to measure dependent variables, while the other study uses 9-point scales. We can even compare effect sizes across completely different measures of the same construct, one study uses a self-report measure, and another study uses a physiological measure. Although we can compare effect sizes across different measurements, this does not mean they are comparable, as we will discuss in more detail in the section on heterogeneity in the chapter on meta-analysis.\nCohen’s d ranges from minus infinity to infinity (although in practice, the mean difference in the positive or negative direction that can be observed will never be infinite), with the value of 0 indicating there is no effect. Cohen (1988) uses subscripts to distinguish different versions of Cohen’s d, a practice I will follow because it prevents confusion (without any specification, Cohen’s d denotes the entire family of effect sizes). Cohen refers to the standardized mean difference between two groups of independent observations for the sample as \\(d_s\\). Before we get into the statistical details, let’s first visualize what a Cohen’s d of 0.001 (as was found in the Facebook study) means. We will use a visualization from http://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend/, a website made by Kristoffer Magnusson, that allows you to visualize the differences between two measurements (such as the increase in negative words used by the Facebook user when the number of positive words on the timeline was reduced). The visualization actually shows two distributions, one dark blue and one light blue, but they overlap so much that the tiny difference in distributions is not visible (click the settings button to change the slider settings, and set the step size to 0.001 to reproduce the figure below in the online app).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: A visualization of 2 groups (although the difference is hardly visible) representing d = 0.001.\n\n\n\n\nThe four numbers below the distribution express the effect size in different ways to facilitate the interpretation. For example, the probability of superiority expresses the probability that a randomly picked observation from one group will have a larger score than a randomly picked observation from the other group. Because the effect is so small, this probability is 50.03% - which means that people in the experimental write almost the same number of positive or negative words as people in the control condition. The number needed to treat index illustrates that in the Facebook study a person needs to type 3570 words before we will observe one additional negative word, compared to the control condition. I don’t know how often you type this many words on Facebook, but I think we can agree this effect is not noticeable on an individual level.\nTo understand how Cohen’s d for two independent groups is calculated, let’s first look at the formula for the t-statistic:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{{\\overline{M}}_{1}{- \\overline{M}}_{2}}{\\text{SD}_{\\text{pooled}} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_{1}} + \\frac{1}{n_{2}}}}\n\\]\nHere \\({\\overline{M}}_{1}{- \\overline{M}}_{2}\\) is the difference between the means, and \\(\\text{SD}_{\\text{pooled}}\\) is the pooled standard deviation (Lakens, 2013), and n1 and n2 are the sample sizes of the two groups that are being compared. The t-value is used to determine whether the difference between two groups in a t-test is statistically significant (as explained in the chapter on p-values. The formula for Cohen’s d is very similar:\n\\[d_s = \\frac{{\\overline{M}}_{1}{-\\overline{M}}_{2}}{\\text{SD}_{\\text{pooled}}}\\]\nAs you can see, the sample size in each group (\\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\)) is part of the formula for a t-value, but it is not part of the formula for Cohen’s d (the pooled standard deviation is computed by weighing the standard deviation in each group by the sample size, but it cancels out if groups are of equal size). This distinction is useful to know, because in practice it means that the t-value (and consequently, the p-value) is a function of the sample size, but Cohen’s d is independent of the sample size. If there is a true effect (e.g., a non-zero effect size in the population) the t-value for a null hypothesis test against an effect of zero will on average become larger (and the p-value will become smaller) as the sample size increases. The effect size, however, will not increase or decrease, but will become more accurate, as the standard error decreases as the sample size increases. This is also the reason why p-values cannot be used to make a statement about whether an effect is practically significant, and effect size estimates are often such an important complement to p-values when making statistical inferences.\nYou can calculate Cohen’s d for independent groups from the independent samples t-value (which can often be convenient when the result section of the paper you are reading does not report effect sizes) through:\n\\[d_s = t ⨯ \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_{1}} + \\frac{1}{n_{2}}}\\]\nA d = 0.001 is an extremely tiny effect, so let’s explore an effect size that is a bit more representative of what you would read in the literature. In the meta-meta-analysis mentioned earlier, the median effect size in published studies included in meta-analyses in the psychological literature is d = 0.43 (Richard et al., 2003). To get a feeling for this effect size, let’s use the online app and set the effect size to d = 0.43.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: A visualization of 2 groups representing d = 0.43.\n\n\n\n\nOne example of a meta-analytic effect size in the meta-meta-analysis that is exactly \\(d_s\\) = 0.43 is the finding that people in a group work less hard to achieve a goal than people who work individually, called social loafing. This is an effect that is large enough that we notice it in daily life. Yet, if we look at the overlap in the two distributions, we see that the amount of effort people put in overlaps considerably between the two conditions (in the case of social loafing, working individually versus working in a group). We see in Figure 6.3 that the probability of superiority, or the probability that if we randomly draw one person from the group condition and one person from the individual condition, the person working in a group puts in less effort, is only 61.9%. This interpretation of differences between groups is also called the common language effect size (McGraw & Wong, 1992).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: A vizualization of 2 groups representing d = 2.\n\n\n\n\nBased on this data, the difference between the height of 21-year old men and women in The Netherlands is approximately 13 centimeters (in an unstandardized effect size), or a standardized effect size of \\(d_s\\) = 2. If I pick a random man and a random woman walking down the street in my hometown of Rotterdam, how likely is it that the man will be taller than the woman? We see this is quite likely, with a probability of superiority of 92.1%. But even with such a huge effect, there is still considerable overlap in the two distributions. If we conclude the height of people in one group is greater than the height of people in another group, this does not mean everyone in one group is taller than everyone in the other group.\nSometimes when you try to explain scientific findings at a birthday party, a skeptical aunt or uncle might remark ‘well I don’t believe that is true because I never experience this’. With probabilistic observations, there is a distribution of observed effects. In the example about social loafing, on average people put in less effort to achieve a goal when working in a group than working by themselves. For any individual in the population, the effect might be larger, smaller, absent, or even in the opposite direction. If your skeptical aunt or uncle never experiences a finding, this does not contradict the claim that the effect exists on average in the population. Indeed, it is even expected that there is no effect for some people in the population, at least some of the time. Although there might be some exceptions (e.g., almost every individual will experience the Stroop effect), many effects are smaller, or have sufficient variation, such that the effect is not present for every single individual in the population.\nConceptually, calculating Cohen’s d for within-subjects comparisons is based on the same idea as for independent groups, where the differences between two observations are divided by the standard deviation within the groups of observations. However, in the case of correlated samples the most common standardizer is the standard deviation of the difference scores. Testing whether two correlated means are significantly different from each other with a paired samples t-test is the same as testing whether the difference scores of the correlated means is significantly different from 0 in a one-sample t-test. Similarly, calculating the effect size for the difference between two correlated means is similar to the effect size that is calculated for a one sample t-test. The standardized mean difference effect size for within-subjects designs is referred to as Cohen’s \\(d_z\\), where the z alludes to the fact that the unit of analysis is no longer x or y, but their difference, z, and can be calculated with:\n\\[d_z = \\frac{M_{dif}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum{({X_{dif}-M_{dif})}}^2}{N-1}}}\\] The effect size estimate Cohen’s \\(d_z\\) can also be calculated directly from the t-value and the number of participants using the formula:\n\\[d_z = \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{n}}\\]\nGiven the direct relationship between the t-value of a paired-samples t-test and Cohen’s \\(d_z\\), it will not be surprising that software that performs power analyses for within-subjects designs (e.g., G*Power) relies on Cohen’s \\(d_z\\) as input.\nMaxwell & Delaney (2004) remark: ‘a major goal of developing effect size measures is to provide a standard metric that meta-analysts and others can interpret across studies that vary in their dependent variables as well as types of designs.’ Because Cohen’s \\(d_z\\) takes the correlation between the dependent measures into account, it cannot be directly compared with Cohen’s \\(d_s\\). Some researchers prefer to use the average standard deviation of both groups of observations as a standardizer (which ignores the correlation between the observations), because this allows for a more direct comparison with Cohen’s \\(d_s\\). This effect size is referred to as Cohen’s \\(d_{av}\\) (Cumming, 2013), and is simply:\n\\[d_{av} = \\frac{M_{dif}}{\\frac{SD_1+SD_2}{2}}\\]"

    "section": "\n6.5 Interpreting effect sizes",
    "text": "6.5 Interpreting effect sizes\nA commonly used interpretation of Cohen’s d is to refer to effect sizes as small (d = 0.2), medium (d = 0.5), and large (d = 0.8) based on benchmarks suggested by Cohen (1988). However, these values are arbitrary and should not be used. In practice, you will only see them used in a form of circular reasoning: The effect is small, because it is d = 0.2, and d = 0.2 is small. We see that using the benchmarks adds nothing, beyond covering up the fact that we did not actually interpret the size of the effect. Furthermore, benchmarks for what is a ‘medium’ and ‘large’ effect do not even correspond between Cohen’s d and r (as explained by McGrath & Meyer (2006), see the ‘Test Yourself’ Q12). Any verbal classification based on benchmarks ignores the fact that any effect can be practically meaningful, such as an intervention that leads to a reliable reduction in suicide rates with an effect size of d = 0.1. In other cases, an effect size of d = 0.1 might have no consequence at all, for example because such an effect is smaller than the just noticeable difference, and is therefore too small to be noticed by individuals in the real world.\nPublication bias and flexibility in the data analysis inflate effect size estimates. Innovations such as Registered Reports (Chambers & Tzavella, 2022; Nosek & Lakens, 2014) increasingly lead to the availability of unbiased effect size estimates in the scientific literature. Registered Reports are scientific publications which have been reviewed before the data has been collected based on the introduction, method, and proposed statistical analysis plan, and published regardless of whether the results were statistically significant or not. One consequence of no longer selectively publishing significant studies is that many effect sizes will turn out to be smaller than researchers thought. For example, in the 100 replication studies performed in the Reproducibility Project: Psychology, observed effect sizes in replication studies were on average half the size as those observed in the original studies (Open Science Collaboration, 2015).\nTo not just report but interpret an effect size, nothing is gained by the common practice of finding the corresponding verbal label of ‘small’, ‘medium’, or ‘large’. Instead, researchers who want to argue that an effect is meaningful need to provide empirical and falsifiable arguments for the meaningfulness of effects (Anvari et al., 2021; Primbs et al., 2022). One approach to argue effect sizes are meaningful is by explicitly specifying a smallest effect size of interest] (Götz et al., 2022), for example based on a cost-benefit analysis. Alternatively, researchers can interpret effect sizes relative to other effects in the literature (Baguley, 2009; Funder & Ozer, 2019)."

    "section": "\n6.6 Correlations and Variance Explained",
    "text": "6.6 Correlations and Variance Explained\nThe r family effect sizes are based on the proportion of variance that is explained by group membership (e.g., a correlation of r = 0.5 indicates 25% of the variance (\\(r^2\\) is explained by the difference between groups). You might remember that r is used to refer to a correlation. The correlation of two continuous variables can range from 0 (completely unrelated) to 1 (perfect positive relationship) or -1 (perfect negative relationship). To get a better feel of correlations, play the game guess the correlation where you will see a scatterplot, and have to guess the correlation between the variables (see Figure 6.5).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Screenshot from Guess the Correlation game (the correct answer is r = 0.24).\n\n\n\n\nThe r family effect sizes are calculated from the sum of squares (the difference between individual observations and the mean for the group, squared, and summed) for the effect divided by the sums of squares for other factors in the design. Earlier, I mentioned the median effect size in psychology is \\(d_s\\) = 0.43. However, the authors actually report their results as a correlation, r = 0.21. We can convert Cohen’s d into r (but take care that this only applies to \\(d_s\\), not \\(d_z\\)):\n\\[r = \\frac{d_s}{\\sqrt{{d_s^{2}}^{+}\\frac{N^{2} - 2N}{n_{1} \\times n_{2}}}}\\]\nN is the total sample size of both groups, whereas \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are the sample sizes of the individual groups you are comparing (it is common to use capital \\(N\\) for the total sample size, and lowercase n for sample sizes per group). You can go to http://rpsychologist.com/d3/correlation/ to look at a good visualization of the proportion of variance that is explained by group membership, and the relationship between r and \\(r^2\\). The amount of variance explained is often quite a small number, and we see in Figure 6.6 that a correlation of 0.21 (the median from the meta-meta-analysis by Richard and colleagues) we see the proportion of variance explained is only 4.4%. Funder and Ozer (2019) warn against misinterpreting small values for the variance explained as an indication that the effect is not meaningful (and they even consider the practice of squaring the correlation “actively misleading”).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Screenshot from correlation effect size vizualization by Kristoffer Magnusson for r = 0.21.\n\n\n\n\nAs we have seen before, it can be useful to interpret effect sizes to identify effects that are practically insignificant, or effects that are implausibly large. Let’s take a look at a study that examines the number of suicides as a function of the amount of country music played on the radio. You can find the paper here It won an Ig Nobel prize for studies that first make you laugh, and then think, although in this case, the the study should not make you think about country music, but about the importance of interpreting effect sizes.\nThe authors predicted the following:\n\nWe contend that the themes found in country music foster a suicidal mood among people already at risk of suicide and that it is thereby associated with a high suicide rate.\n\nThen they collected data:\n\nOur sample is comprised of 49 large metropolitan areas for which data on music were available. Exposure to country music is measured as the proportion of radio airtime devoted to country music. Suicide data were extracted from the annual Mortality Tapes, obtained from the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan. The dependent variable is the number of suicides per 100,000 population.\n\nAnd they concluded:\n\nA significant zero-order correlation was found between white suicide rates and country music (r = .54, p &lt; .05). The greater the airtime given to country music, the greater the white suicide rate.\n\nWe can again compare the size of this effect with other known effects in psychology. In the database by Richard and colleagues, there are very few effects this large, but some examples are: that leaders are most effective if they have charisma (r = 0.54), good leader–subordinate relations promote subordinate satisfaction (r = 0.53), and people can recognize emotions across cultures (r = 0.53). These effects are all large and obvious, which should raise some doubts about whether the relationship between listening to country music and suicides can be of the same size. Is country music really that bad? If we search the literature, we find that other researchers were not able to reproduce the analysis of the original authors. It is likely that the results are spurious, or a Type 1 error.\nEta squared \\(\\eta^2\\) (part of the r family of effect sizes, and an extension of r that can be used for more than two sets of observations) measures the proportion of the variation in Y that is associated with membership of the different groups defined by X, or the sum of squares of the effect divided by the total sum of squares:\n\\[\\eta^{2} = \\frac{\\text{SS}_{\\text{effect}}}{\\text{SS}_{\\text{total}}}\\]\nAn \\(\\eta^2\\) of .13 means that 13% of the total variance can be accounted for by group membership. Although \\(\\eta^2\\) is an efficient way to compare the sizes of effects within a study (given that every effect is interpreted in relation to the total variance, all \\(\\eta^2\\) from a single study sum to 100%), eta squared cannot easily be compared between studies, because the total variability in a study (\\(SS_{total}\\)) depends on the design of a study, and increases when additional variables are manipulated (e.g., when independent variables are added). Keppel (Keppel, 1991) has recommended partial eta squared (\\(\\eta_{p}^{2}\\)) to improve the comparability of effect sizes between studies. \\(\\eta_{p}^{2}\\) expresses the sum of squares of the effect in relation to the sum of squares of the effect plus the sum of squares of the error associated with the effect. Partial eta squared is calculated as:\n\\[\\eta_{p}^{2} = \\frac{\\text{SS}_{\\text{effect}}}{\\text{SS}_{\\text{effect}} + \\text{SS}_{\\text{error}}}\\]\nFor designs with fixed factors (manipulated factors, or factors that exhaust all levels of the independent variable, such as alive vs. dead), but not for designs with measured factors or covariates, partial eta squared can be computed from the F-value and its degrees of freedom (Cohen, 1988):\n\\[\\eta_{p}^{2} = \\frac{F \\times \\text{df}_{\\text{effect}}}{{F \\times \\text{df}}_{\\text{effect}} + \\text{df}_{\\text{error}}}\\]\nFor example, for an F(1, 38) = 7.21, \\(\\eta_{p}^{2}\\) = 7.21 ⨯ 1/(7.21 ⨯ 1 + 38) = 0.16.\nEta squared can be transformed into Cohen’s d:\nd = 2\\(\\times f\\) where \\(f^{2} = \\eta^{2}/(1 - \\eta^{2})\\)"

    "text": "6.7 Correcting for Bias\nPopulation effect sizes are almost always estimated on the basis of samples, and as a measure of the population effect size estimate based on sample averages, Cohen’s d slightly overestimates the true population effect. When Cohen’s d refers to the population, the Greek letter \\(\\delta\\) is typically used. Therefore, corrections for bias are used (even though these corrections do not always lead to a completely unbiased effect size estimate). In the d family of effect sizes, the correction for bias in the population effect size estimate of Cohen’s d is known as Hedges’ g (although different people use different names – \\(d_{unbiased}\\) is also used). This correction for bias is only noticeable in small sample sizes, but since we often use software to calculate effect sizes anyway, it makes sense to always report Hedge’s g instead of Cohen’s d (Thompson, 2007).\nAs with Cohen’s d, \\(\\eta^2\\) is a biased estimate of the true effect size in the population. Two less biased effect size estimates have been proposed, epsilon squared \\(\\varepsilon^{2}\\) and omega squared \\(\\omega^{2}\\). For all practical purposes, these two effect sizes correct for bias equally well (Albers & Lakens, 2018; Okada, 2013), and should be preferred above \\(\\eta^2\\). Partial epsilon squared (\\(\\varepsilon_{p}^{2}\\)) and partial omega squared (\\(\\omega_{p}^{2}\\)) can be calculated based on the F-value and degrees of freedom.\n\\[\n\\omega_{p}^{2} = \\frac{F - 1}{F + \\ \\frac{\\text{df}_{\\text{error}} + 1}{\\text{df}_{\\text{effect}}}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_{p}^{2} = \\frac{F - 1}{F + \\ \\frac{\\text{df}_{\\text{error}}}{\\text{df}_{\\text{effect}}}}\n\\] Partial effect sizes \\(\\eta_{p}^{2}\\), \\(\\varepsilon_{p}^{2}\\) and \\(\\omega_{p}^{2}\\) cannot be generalized across different designs. For this reason, generalized eta-squared (\\(\\eta_{G}^{2}\\)) and generalized omega-squared (\\(\\omega_{G}^{2}\\)) have been proposed (Olejnik & Algina, 2003), although they are not very popular. In part, this might be because summarizing the effect size in an ANOVA design with a single index has limitations, and perhaps it makes more sense to describe the pattern of results, as we will see in the section below."

    "section": "\n6.8 Effect Sizes for Interactions",
    "text": "6.8 Effect Sizes for Interactions\nThe effect size used for power analyses for ANOVA designs is Cohen’s f. For two independent groups, Cohen’s \\(f\\) = 0.5 * Cohen’s d. For more than two groups, Cohen’s f can be converted into eta-squared and back with \\(f = \\frac{\\eta^2}{(1 - \\eta^2)}\\) or \\(\\eta^2 = \\frac{f^2}{(1 + f^2)}\\). When predicting interaction effects in ANOVA designs, planning the study based on an expected effect size such as \\(\\eta_{p}^{2}\\) or Cohen’s f might not be the most intuitive approach.\nLet’s start with the effect size for a simple two group comparison. Let’s assume we predict a mean difference of 1, and know the standard deviation of the measure is 2. This means the standardized effect size is d = 0.5. An independent t-test is mathematically identical to an F-test with two groups. For an F-test, the effect size used for power analyses is Cohen’s f, which is calculated based on the standard deviation of the population means divided by the population standard deviation (which we know for our measure is 2), or:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nf = \\frac{\\sigma _{ m }}{\\sigma}\n\\end{equation}\\] where for equal sample sizes \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\sigma _{ m } = \\sqrt { \\frac { \\sum_ { i = 1 } ^ { k } ( m _ { i } - m ) ^ { 2 } } { k } }.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn this formula m is the grand mean, k is the number of means, and \\(m_i\\) is the mean in each group. The formula above might look a bit daunting, but calculating Cohen’s f is not that difficult for two groups.\nIf we take the expected means of 0 and 1, and a standard deviation of 2, the grand mean (the m in the formula above) is (0 + 1)/2 = 0.5. The formula says we should subtract this grand mean from the mean of each group, square this value, and sum them. So we have (0 - 0.5)^2 and (1 - 0.5)^2, which are both 0.25. We sum these values (0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5), divide them by the number of groups (0.5/2 = 0.25) and take the square root, we find that \\(\\sigma_{ m }\\) = 0.5. We can now calculate Cohen’s f (using \\(\\sigma\\) = 2 for our measure):\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nf = \\frac{\\sigma _{ m }}{\\sigma} = \\frac{0.5}{2} = 0.25\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWe confirm that for two groups Cohen’s f is half as large as Cohen’s d.\nNow we have the basis to look at interaction effects. Different patterns of means in an ANOVA can have the same Cohen’s f. There are two types of interactions, as visualized below in Figure 6.7. In an ordinal interaction, the mean of one group (“B1”) is always higher than the mean for the other group (“B2”). Disordinal interactions are also known as ‘cross-over’ interactions, and occur when the group with the larger mean switches over. The difference is important, since the disordinal interaction in Figure 6.7 has a larger effect size than the ordinal interaction.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Schematic illustration of a disordinal (or cross-over) and ordinal interaction.\n\n\n\n\nMathematically the interaction effect is computed as the cell mean minus the sum of the grand mean, the marginal mean in each condition of one factor minus the grand mean, and the marginal mean in each condition for the other factor minus grand mean (Maxwell & Delaney, 2004).\nLet’s consider two cases, one where we have a perfect disordinal interaction (the means of 0 and 1 flip around in the other condition, and are 1 and 0) or an ordinal interaction (the effect is present in one condition, with means 0 and 1, but disappears in the other condition, with means 0 and 0, see Figure 6.8).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Disordinal (or cross-over) and ordinal interaction with means of 0 and 1, n = 50 per group, and an sd of 2.\n\n\n\n\nWe can calculate the interaction effect as follows (we will go through the steps in some detail). First, let’s look at the disordinal interaction. The grand mean is (1 + 0 + 0 + 1) / 4 = 0.5.\nWe can compute the marginal means for A1, A2, B1, and B2, which is simply averaging per row and column, which gets us for the A1 row (1+0)/2=0.5. For this perfect disordinal interaction, all marginal means are 0.5. This means there are no main effects. There is no main effect of factor A (because the marginal means for A1 and A2 are both exactly 0.5), nor is there a main effect of B.\nWe can also calculate the interaction effect. For each cell we take the value in the cell (e.g., for a1b1 this is 1) and compute the difference between the cell mean and the additive effect of the two factors as:\n1 - (the grand mean of 0.5 + (the marginal mean of a1 minus the grand mean, or 0.5 - 0.5 = 0) + (the marginal mean of b1 minus the grand mean, or 0.5 - 0.5 = 0)). Thus, for each cell we get:\na1b1: 1 - (0.5 + (0.5 -0.5) + (0.5 -0.5)) = 0.5\na1b2: 0 - (0.5 + (0.5 -0.5) + (0.5 -0.5)) = -0.5\na2b1: 0 - (0.5 + (0.5 -0.5) + (0.5 -0.5)) = -0.5\na2b2: 1 - (0.5 + (0.5 -0.5) + (0.5 -0.5)) = 0.5\nCohen’s \\(f\\) is then \\(f = \\frac { \\sqrt { \\frac { 0.5^2 +-0.5^2 + -0.5^2 + 0.5^2 } { 4 } }}{ 2 } = 0.25\\)\nFor the ordinal interaction the grand mean is (1 + 0 + 0 + 0) / 4, or 0.25. The marginal means are a1: 0.5, a2: 0, b1: 0.5, and b2: 0.\nCompleting the calculation for all four cells for the ordinal interaction gives:\na1b1: 1 - (0.25 + (0.5 -0.25) + (0.5 -0.25)) = 0.25\na1b2: 0 - (0.25 + (0.5 -0.25) + (0.0 -0.25)) = -0.25\na2b1: 0 - (0.25 + (0.0 -0.25) + (0.5 -0.25)) = -0.25\na2b2: 0 - (0.25 + (0.0 -0.25) + (0.0 -0.25)) = 0.25\nCohen’s \\(f\\) is then \\(f = \\frac { \\sqrt { \\frac { 0.25^2 +-0.25^2 + -0.25^2 + 0.25^2 } { 4 } }}{ 2 } = 0.125\\).\nWe see the effect size of the cross-over interaction (f = 0.25) is twice as large as the effect size of the ordinal interaction (f = 0.125). This should make sense if we think about the interaction as a test of contrasts. In the disordinal interaction we are comparing cells a1b1 and a2b2 against a1b2 and a2b1, or (1+1)/2 vs. (0+0)/2. Thus, if we see this as a t-test for a contrast, we see the mean difference is 1. For the ordinal interaction, we have (1+0)/2 vs. (0+0)/2, so the mean difference is halved, namely 0.5. This obviously matters for the statistical power we will have when we examine interaction effects in our experiments.\nJust stating that you expect a ‘medium’ Cohen’s f effect size for an interaction effect in your power analysis is not the best approach. Instead, start by thinking about the pattern of means and standard deviations (and for within factors, the correlation between dependent variables) and then compute the effect size from the data pattern. If you prefer not to do so by hand, you can use Superpower (Lakens & Caldwell, 2021). This also holds for more complex designs, such as multilevel models. In these cases, it is often the case that power analyses are easier based on simulation-based approaches, than based on plugging in a single effect size in power analysis software (DeBruine & Barr, 2021)."

Look at the scatterplot and the shared variance for an effect size of r = .21 (Richard et al., 2003).

Using the online MOTE app https://doomlab.shinyapps.io/mote/ (choose Independent t -t from the Mean Differences dropdown menu) or the MOTE R function d.ind.t.t, what is the effect size Cohen’s d for this effect, given 38 participants (e.g., 19 in each group, leading to N – 2 = 36 degrees of freedom) and an alpha level of 0.05?\n\n\nd = 0.38d = 0.41d = 0.71d = 0.75\n\n\nQ8: In an old paper you find a statistical result from a 2x3 between subjects ANOVA reported as F(2, 122) = 4.13, p &lt; 0.05, without a reported effect size.

We can use the effectsize R package (that can also be used to compute effect sizes when you analyze your data in R) to convert the median r = 0.21 observed in Richard and colleagues’ meta-meta-analysis to d: effectsize::r_to_d(0.21) which (assuming equal sample sizes per condition) yields d = 0.43 (the conversion assumes equal sample sizes in each group). Which Cohen’s d corresponds to a r = 0.1?\n\n\nd = 0.05d = 0.10d = 0.20d = 0.30\n\n\nQ11: It can be useful to convert effect sizes to r when performing a meta-analysis where not all effect sizes that are included are based on mean differences.

The benchmarks typically used for ‘small’, ‘medium’, and ‘large’ effects for Cohen’s d are d = 0.2, d = 0.5, and d = 0.8, and for a correlation are r = 0.1, r = 0.3, and r = 0.5. Using the d_to_r() function in the effectsize package, check to see whether the benchmark for a ‘large’ effect size correspond between d and r.\nAs McGrath & Meyer (2006) write: “Many users of Cohen’s (1988) benchmarks seem unaware that those for the correlation coefficient and d are not strictly equivalent, because Cohen’s generally cited benchmarks for the correlation were intended for the infrequently used biserial correlation rather than for the point biserial.”\nDownload the paper by McGrath and Meyer, 2006 (you can find links to the pdf here), and on page 390, right column, read which solution the authors prefer.\n\n\nThink carefully about the limitations of using benchmarks.Just stop using these silly benchmarks.The benchmarks for d would need to be changed to 0.20, 0.67, and 1.15The benchmarks for correlations would need to be changed to .10, .24, and .37\n\n\n\n\n6.9.1 Open Questions\n\nWhat is the difference between standardized and unstandardized effect sizes?\nGive a definition of an ‘effect size’.\nWhat are some of the main uses of effect sizes?\nHow can effect sizes improve statistical inferences, beyond looking at the p-value?\nWhat is the effect size r?\nWhat is the effect size d?\nWhat are the unbiased effect sizes that correspond to d and eta-squared called?\nGive an example when small effects are meaningless, and when they are not.\nWhat values can Cohen’s d take?\nWhat values can a correlation (r) take?\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbers, C.

    "text": "7.1 Population vs. Sample\nIn statistics, we differentiate between the population and the sample. The population is everyone you are interested in, such as all people in the world, elderly who are depressed, or people who buy innovative products. Your sample is everyone you were able to measure from the population you are interested in. We similarly distinguish between a parameter and a statistic. A parameter is a characteristic of the population, while a statistic is a characteristic of a sample. Sometimes, you have data about your entire population. For example, we have measured the height of all the people who have ever walked on the moon. We can calculate the average height of these twelve individuals, and so we know the true parameter. We do not need inferential statistics. However, we do not know the average height of all people who have ever walked on the earth. Therefore, we need to estimate this parameter, using a statistic based on a sample. Although it is rare that a study includes the entire population, it is not impossible, as illustrated in Figure 7.1.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Example of a registry-based study in which the entire population was included in the study. From https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab066\n\n\n\n\nWhen the entire population is measured there is no need to perform a hypothesis test. After all, there is no population to generalize to (although it is possible to argue we are still making an inference, even when the entire population is observed, because we have observed a metaphorical population from one of many possible worlds, see Spiegelhalter (2019)). When data from the entire population has been collected, the population effect size is known and there is no confidence interval to compute. If the total population size is known, but not measured completely, then the confidence interval width should shrink to zero the closer a study gets to measuring the entire population. This is known as the finite population correction factor for the variance of the estimator (Kish, 1965). The variance of a sample mean is \\(\\sigma^2/n\\), which for finite populations is multiplied by the finite population correction factor of the standard error: \\[FPC = \\sqrt{\\frac{(N - n)}{(N-1)}}\\] where N is the size of the population, and n is the size of the sample. When N is much larger than n, the correction factor will be close to 1 (and therefore this correction is typically ignored when populations are very large, even when populations are finite), and will not have a noticeable effect on the variance. When the total population is measured the correction factor is 0, such that the variance becomes 0 as well. For example, when the total population consists of 100 top athletes, and data is collected from a sample of 35 athletes, the finite population correction is \\(\\sqrt{(100 - 35)/(100-1)}\\) = 0.81. The superb R package can compute population corrected confidence intervals (Cousineau & Chiasson, 2019)."

This behavior of confidence intervals is nicely visualized on this website by Kristoffer Magnusson: http://rpsychologist.com/d3/CI/. In Figure 7.2 we see blue dots that represent means from a sample, and that fall around a red dashed vertical line, which represents the true value of the parameter in the population. Due to variation in the sample, the estimates do not all fall on the red dashed line. The horizontal lines around the blue dots are the confidence intervals. By default, the visualization shows 95% confidence intervals. Most of the lines are black (which means the confidence interval overlaps with the orange dashed line indicating the true population value), but some are red (indicating they do not capture the true population value). In the long run, 95% of the horizontal bars will be black, and 5% will be red.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Series of simulated point estimates and confidence intervals.\n\n\n\n\nWe can now see what is meant by the sentence “Confidence intervals are a statement about the percentage of confidence intervals that contain the true parameter value“. In the long run, for 95% of the samples, the orange dashed line (the population parameter) is contained within the 95% confidence interval around the sample mean, and in 5% of the confidence intervals this is not true. As we will see when we turn to the formula for confidence intervals, the width of a confidence interval depends on the sample size and the standard deviation. The larger the sample size, the smaller the confidence intervals."

    "section": "\n7.3 Interpreting a single confidence interval",
    "text": "7.3 Interpreting a single confidence interval\nWhenever we compute or encounter a single confidence interval it is important to realize that someone else performing exactly the same experiment would, purely due to random variation, have observed a different confidence interval, effect size, and p-value. Because of this random variation a single confidence interval is difficult to interpret. Misinterpretations are common. For example, Cumming (2014) writes “We can be 95% confident that our interval includes μ and can think of the lower and upper limits as likely lower and upper bounds for μ.” Both these statements are incorrect (Morey et al., 2016). It is incorrect to claim we can be 95% confident that our interval includes the true population mean, because if we study whether our friend can predict whether a coin comes up heads or tails in 100 flips, and they correctly predict the coin flip in 61 out of 100 flips with a 95% confidence interval from 0.507 to 0.706, it is perfectly reasonable to use some Bayesian reasoning and assume (with more than the remaining 5% confidence) it was just a fluke, and the true success rate when guessing the outcome of coin flips is 50%. It is also incorrect to believe the lower and upper limits are likely lower and upper bounds for μ, as anyone else performing the same experiment would have observed a different confidence interval, with a different upper and lower bound, when analyzing a single sample drawn from the same population. If a lot of data has been collected (say thousands of observations) this problem practically disappears, because the remaining uncertainty is too small to matter.\nOne useful way to think of a confidence interval is as an indication of the resolution with which an effect is estimated. If the resolution is low, it is difficult to get a clear picture, but if the resolution is extremely high, the picture is clear enough for all practical use cases. If we have estimated an effect in a very narrow range, say a M = 0.52, 95% CI [0.49; 0.55], and we feel warranted to assume that no one cares about differences less than 0.05 on the measure, a confidence interval communicates that the data have been estimated with sufficient precision. Similarly, if the sample size is small, and the confidence is very wide, say a M = 0.52, 95% CI [0.09; 0.95], and we feel warranted to assume that differences of almost 1 on the measure matter for situations in which the estimate would be used, the confidence interval communicates that the effect size estimate is not precise enough. This evaluation of the resolution of the estimate can be useful, and is missing if only a p-value or effect size are reported. For this reason, it is recommended to report confidence intervals around estimates. Confidence intervals are often reported within brackets, but an interesting alternative (especially for tables) is to use subscripts: \\(_{0.09}0.52_{0.95}\\) (Louis & Zeger, 2009).\nIt is tempting to use a Bayesian interpretation of a single confidence interval, where one would say “I believe there is a 95% probability that this interval contains the true population parameter”. A Bayesian interpretation has lost frequentist error control which means that depending on the prior this belief might be misguided in much more than 5% of the studies. This is not something a Bayesian worries about, as the focus of their inferences is not on limiting errors in the long run, but on quantifying beliefs. A frequentist can not make probability claims for single observations. After the data has been collected, a frequentist can only state that the current confidence interval either contains the true population parameter, or it does not. In the long run, \\(\\alpha\\)% of the confidence intervals will not include the true population parameter, and this single confidence interval could be one of these flukes. Even though a frequentist and Bayesian confidence interval can be identical under certain priors (Albers et al., 2018), the different definitions of probability lead to different interpretations of a single confidence interval. A frequentist can easily interpret a confidence procedure, but it is not so easy to interpret a single confidence interval (Morey et al., 2016). This should not surprise us, because it is difficult to interpret any single study (which is why we need to perform replication studies). When confidence intervals are interpreted as a long-run procedure, they are directly related to p-values."

    "section": "\n7.4 The relation between confidence intervals and p-values",
    "text": "7.4 The relation between confidence intervals and p-values\nThere is a direct relationship between the CI around an effect size and statistical significance of a null-hypothesis significance test. For example, if an effect is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) in a two-sided independent t-test with an alpha of .05, the 95% CI for the mean difference between the two groups will not include zero. Confidence intervals are sometimes said to be more informative than p-values, because they not only provide information about whether an effect is statistically significant (i.e., when the confidence interval does not overlap with the value representing the null hypothesis), but also communicate the precision of the effect size estimate. This is true, but as mentioned in the chapter on p-values it is still recommended to add exact p-values, which facilitates the re-use of results for secondary analyses (Appelbaum et al., 2018), and allows other researchers to compare the p-value to an alpha level they would have preferred to use (Lehmann & Romano, 2005).\nIn order to maintain the direct relationship between a confidence interval and a p-value it is necessary to adjust the confidence interval level whenever the alpha level is adjusted. For example, if an alpha level of 5% is corrected for three comparisons to 0.05/3 - 0.0167, the corresponding confidence interval would be a 1 - 0.0167 = 0.9833 confidence interval. Similarly, if a p-value is computed for a one-sided t-test, there is only an upper or lower limit of the interval, and the other end of the interval ranges to −∞ or ∞.\nTo maintain a direct relationship between an F-test and its confidence interval, a 90% CI for effect sizes from an F-test should be provided. The reason for this is explained by Karl Wuensch. Where Cohen’s d can take both positive and negative values, r² or η² are squared, and can therefore only take positive values. This is related to the fact that F-tests (as commonly used in ANOVA) are one-sided. If you calculate a 95% CI, you can get situations where the confidence interval includes 0, but the test reveals a statistical difference with a p &lt; .05 (for a more mathematical explanation, see Steiger (2004)). This means that a 95% CI around Cohen’s d in an independent t-test equals a 90% CI around η² for exactly the same test performed as an ANOVA. As a final detail, because eta-squared cannot be smaller than zero, the lower bound for the confidence interval cannot be smaller than 0. This means that a confidence interval for an effect that is not statistically different from 0 has to start at 0. You report such a CI as 90% CI [.00; .XX] where the XX is the upper limit of the CI.\nConfidence intervals are often used in forest plots that communicate the results from a meta-analysis. In the plot below, we see 4 rows. Each row shows the effect size estimate from one study (in Hedges’ g). For example, study 1 yielded an effect size estimate of 0.44, with a confidence interval around the effect size from 0.08 to 0.8. The horizontal black line, similarly to the visualization we played around with before, is the width of the confidence interval. When it does not touch the effect size 0 (indicated by a black vertical dotted line) the effect is statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Meta-analysis of 4 studies.\n\n\n\n\nWe can see, based on the fact that the confidence intervals do not overlap with 0, that studies 1 and 3 were statistically significant. The diamond shape named the FE model (Fixed Effect model) is the meta-analytic effect size. Instead of using a black horizontal line, the upper limit and lower limit of the confidence interval are indicated by the left and right points of the diamond, and the center of the diamond is the meta-analytic effect size estimate. A meta-analysis calculates the effect size by combining and weighing all studies. The confidence interval for a meta-analytic effect size estimate is always narrower than that for a single study, because of the combined sample size of all studies included in the meta-analysis.\nIn the preceding section, we focused on examining whether the confidence interval overlapped with 0. This is a confidence interval approach to a null-hypothesis significance test. Even though we are not computing a p-value, we can directly see from the confidence interval whether p &lt; \\(\\alpha\\). The confidence interval approach to hypothesis testing makes it quite intuitive to think about performing tests against non-zero null hypotheses (Bauer & Kieser, 1996). For example, we could test whether we can reject an effect of 0.5 by examining if the 95% confidence interval does not overlap with 0.5. We can test whether an effect is smaller that 0.5 by examining if the 95% confidence interval falls completely below 0.5. We will see that this leads to a logical extension of null-hypothesis testing where, instead of testing to reject an effect of 0, we can test whether we can reject other effects of interest in range predictions and equivalence tests."

    "section": "\n7.5 The Standard Error and 95% Confidence Intervals",
    "text": "7.5 The Standard Error and 95% Confidence Intervals\nTo calculate a confidence interval, we need the standard error. The standard error (SE) estimates the variability between sample means that would be obtained after taking several measurements from the same population. It is easy to confuse it with the standard deviation, which is the degree to which individuals within the sample differ from the sample mean. Formally, statisticians distinguish between σ and \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}\\), where the hat means the value is estimated from a sample, and the lack of a hat means it is the population value – but I’ll leave out the hat, even when I’ll mostly talk about estimated values based on a sample in the formulas below. Mathematically (where σ is the standard deviation),\n\\[\nStandard \\ Error \\ (SE) = \\sigma/\\sqrt n\n\\]\nThe standard error of the sample will tend to zero with increasing sample size, because the estimate of the population mean will become more and more accurate. The standard deviation of the sample will become more and more similar to the population standard deviation as the sample size increases, but it will not become smaller. Where the standard deviation is a statistic that is descriptive of your sample, the standard error describes bounds on a random sampling process.\nThe standard error is used to construct confidence intervals (CI) around sample estimates, such as the mean, or differences between means, or whatever statistics you might be interested in. To calculate a confidence interval around a mean (indicated by the Greek letter mu: μ), we use the t distribution with the corresponding degrees of freedom (df : in a one-sample t-test, the degrees of freedom are n-1):\n\\[\n\\mu \\pm t_{df, 1-(\\alpha/2)} SE\n\\]\nWith a 95% confidence interval, the \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05, and thus the critical t-value for the degrees of freedom for 1- \\(\\alpha\\) /2, or the 0.975th quantile is calculated. Remember that a t-distribution has slightly thicker tails than a Z-distribution. Where the 0.975th quantile for a Z-distribution is 1.96, the value for a t-distribution with for example df = 19 is 2.093. This value is multiplied by the standard error, and added (for the upper limit of the confidence interval) or subtracted (for the lower limit of the confidence interval) from the mean."

The two confidence intervals around the means of X and Y are commonly shown in a figure in a scientific article. The third dot, slightly larger, is the mean difference between X and Y, and the slightly thicker line visualizes the confidence interval of this mean difference. The difference score is expressed using the axis on the right (from -3 to 5). In the plot below, the mean of group X is 3, the mean of group Y is 5.6, and the difference is 2.6. The plot is based on 50 observations per group, and the confidence interval around the mean difference ranges from 0.49 to 4.68, which is quite wide.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Means and 95% confidence intervals of two independent groups and the mean difference between the two groups and its 95% confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, when a 95% confidence interval does not contain 0, the effect is statistically different from 0. In Figure 7.4 above, the mean difference and the 95% confidence interval around it are indicated by the ‘difference’ label. As the 95% confidence interval does not contain 0, the t-test is significant at an alpha of 0.05. The p-value is indicated in the plot as 0.016. Even though the two means differ statistically significantly from each other, the confidence interval around each mean overlap. One might intuitively believe that an effect is only statistically significant if the confidence interval around the individual means do not overlap, but this is not true. The significance test is related to the confidence interval around the mean difference."

Sometimes, researchers want to predict the interval within which a single value will fall. This is called the prediction interval. It is always much wider than a confidence interval. The reason is that individual observations can vary substantially, but means of future samples (which fall within a normal confidence interval 95% of the time) will vary much less.\nIn Figure 7.5, the orange background illustrates the 95% confidence interval around the mean, and the yellow background illustrates the 95% prediction interval (PI).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: A comparison of a 95% confidence interval (orange) and 95% prediction interval (yellow).\n\n\n\n\nTo calculate the prediction interval, we need a slightly different formula for the standard error than that which was used for the confidence interval, namely:\n\\[\nStandard \\ Error \\ (SE) = \\sigma/\\sqrt(1+1/n)\n\\]\nWhen we rewrite the formula used for the confidence interval to \\(\\sigma/\\sqrt(1/N)\\), we see that the difference between a confidence interval and the prediction interval is in the “1+” which always leads to wider intervals.

The fact that prediction intervals are wide is a good reminder that it is difficult to predict what will happen for any single individual."

    "text": "7.8 Capture Percentages\nIt can be difficult to understand why a 95% confidence interval does not provide us with the interval where 95% of future means will fall. The percentage of means that falls within a single confidence interval is called the capture percentage. A capture percentage is not something we would ever use to make inferences about data, but it is useful to learn about capture percentages to prevent misinterpreting confidence intervals. In Figure 7.6 we see two randomly simulated studies with the same sample size from the same population. The true effect size in both studies is 0, and we see that the 95% confidence intervals for both studies contain the true population value of 0. However, the two confidence intervals cover quite different ranges of effect sizes, with the confidence interval in Study 1 ranging from -0.07 to 0.48, and the confidence interval in Study 2 ranging from -0.50 to 0.06. It cannot be true that in the future, we should expect 95% of the effect sizes to fall between -0.07 to 0.48 and 95% of the effect sizes to fall between -0.50 to 0.06.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6: Meta-analysis of two simulated studies from the same population.\n\n\n\n\nThe only situation in which a 95% confidence interval happens to also be a 95% capture percentage is when the observed effect size in a sample happens to be exactly the same as the true population parameter. In Figure 7.6, that means we would need to observe an effect of exactly 0. However, you can’t know whether the observed effect size happens to be exactly the same as the population effect size. When a sample estimate is not identical to the true population value (which is almost always the case) less than 95% of future effect sizes will fall within the CI from your current sample. As we have observed two studies with the observed effect sizes a bit removed from the true effect size, we will find effect size estimates in future studies that fall outside the observed 95% confidence interval quite often. So, the percentage of future means that fall within a single confidence interval depends upon which single confidence interval you happened to observe. Based on simulation studies it is possible to show that on average, in the long run, a 95% CI has an 83.4% capture probability (Cumming & Maillardet, 2006)."

In small samples, this estimate can be quite far off. But due to the law of large numbers, as our sample size increases, we will be measuring the standard deviation more accurately. Since the sample standard deviation is an estimate with uncertainty, we can calculate a 95% confidence interval around it.\nKeeping the uncertainty of standard deviations in mind can be important. When researchers perform an a-priori power analysis based on an effect size of interest expressed on a raw scale, they need accurate estimates of the standard deviation. Sometimes researchers will use pilot data to get an estimate of the standard deviation. Since the estimate of the population standard deviation based on a pilot study has some uncertainty (as pilot studies usually have a relatively small sample size), the a-priori power analysis will inherit this uncertainty (see the ‘Test Yourself’ questions below). To circumvent this, use validated or existing measures for which accurate estimates of the standard deviation in your population of interest are available. And keep in mind that all estimates from a sample have uncertainty."

    "text": "7.10 Computing Confidence Intervals around Effect Sizes\nIn 1994, Cohen (1994) reflected on the reason confidence intervals were rarely reported: “I suspect that the main reason they are not reported is that they are so embarrassingly large!” This might be, but another reason might have been that statistical software rarely provided confidence intervals around effect sizes in the time when Cohen wrote his article. It has become increasingly easy to report confidence intervals with the popularity of free software packages in R, even though these packages might not provide solutions for all statistical tests yet. The Journal Article Reporting Standards recommend to report “effect-size estimates and confidence intervals on estimates that correspond to each inferential test conducted, when possible”.\nOne easy solution to calculating effect sizes and confidence intervals is MOTE made by Dr. Erin Buchanan and her lab. The website comes with a full collection of tutorials, comparisons with other software packages, and demonstration videos giving accessible overviews of how to compute effect sizes and confidence intervals for a wide range of tests based on summary statistics. This means that whichever software you use to perform statistical tests, you can enter sample sizes and means, standard deviations, or test statistics to compute effect sizes and their confidence intervals. For example, the video below gives an overview of how to compute a confidence interval around Cohen’s d for an independent t-test.\n\n\nMOTE is also available as an R package (Buchanan et al., 2017). Although many solutions exists to compute Cohen’s d, MOTE sets itself apart by allowing researchers to compute effect sizes and confidence intervals for many additional effect sizes, such as (partial) omega squared for between subjects ANOVA (\\(\\omega^{2}\\) and \\(\\omega^{2}_p\\)), generalized omega squared for ANOVA (\\(\\omega^{2}_G\\)), epsilon squared for ANOVA (\\(\\varepsilon^{2}\\)) and (partial) generalized eta squared for ANOVA (\\(\\eta^{2}_G\\)).\n\nMOTE::d.ind.t(m1 = 1.7, m2 = 2.1, sd1 = 1.01, sd2 = 0.96, n1 = 77, n2 = 78, a = .05)$estimate\n\n[1] \"$d_s$ = -0.41, 95\\\\% CI [-0.72, -0.09]\"\n\n\nMBESS is another R package that has a range of options to compute effect sizes and their confidence intervals (Kelley, 2007). The code below reproduces the example for MOTE above.\n\nMBESS::smd(Mean.1 = 1.7, Mean.2 = 2.1, s.1 = 1.01, s.2 = 0.96, n.1 = 77, n.2 = 78)\n\n[1] -0.406028\n\n\nIf you feel comfortable analyzing your data in R, the effectsize package offers a complete set of convenient solutions to compute effect sizes and confidence intervals (Ben-Shachar et al., 2020).\n\nset.seed(33)\nx &lt;- rnorm(n = 20, mean = 0, sd = 2.5) # create sample from normal distribution\ny &lt;- rnorm(n = 200, mean = 1.5, sd = 3.5) # create sample from normal distribution\n\neffectsize::cohens_d(x, y)\n\n\n\n\nCohens_d\nCI\nCI_low\nCI_high\n\n\n-0.443983\n0.95\n-0.9050134\n0.0180575\n\n\n\n\n\nI am personally impressed by the way the effectsize package incorporates the state of the art (although I might be a bit biased). For example, after our recommendation to, by default, use Welch’s t-test instead of students t-test (Delacre et al., 2017), and based on a recent simulation study recommended to report Hedges’ \\(g_s^*\\) as the effect size for Welch’s t-test (Delacre et al., 2021), the effectsize package was the first to incorporate it.\n\neffectsize::cohens_d(x, y, pooled_sd = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nCohens_d\nCI\nCI_low\nCI_high\n\n\n-0.5328286\n0.95\n-0.8972773\n-0.1613138\n\n\n\n\n\nFree statistical software jamovi and JASP are strong alternatives to SPSS that (unlike SPSS) allows users to compute Cohen’s d and the confidence interval for both independent and dependent t-tests.\nFor jamovi, the ESCI module allows users to compute effect sizes and confidence intervals, and is accompanied by educational material that focuses more on estimation and less on testing (Cumming & Calin-Jageman, 2016).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.7: Output from ESCI module in jamovi.\n\n\n\n\nJASP offers a wide range of frequentist and Bayesian analyses, and in addition to Cohen’s d also allows users to compute omega squared \\(\\omega^{2}\\), the less biased version of \\(\\eta^{2}\\) (Albers & Lakens, 2018; Okada, 2013).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.8: JASP menu option allows you to select Cohen’s d and a CI around it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.9: JASP output returns Cohen’s d and the confidence interval around it."

    "text": "7.11 Test Yourself\n\nQ1: Go to the online app by Kristoffer Magnusson: http://rpsychologist.com/d3/CI/. You might want more confidence intervals to contain the true population parameter than 95%. Drag the ‘Slide me’ button to the far right, and you will see the simulation for 99% confidence intervals. Which statement is true?\n\n\nThe confidence intervals are larger, and the sample means fall closer to the true mean.The confidence intervals are smaller, and the sample means fall closer to the true mean.The confidence intervals are larger, and the sample means fall as close to the true mean as for a 95% confidence interval.The confidence intervals are smaller, and the sample means fall as close to the true mean as for a 95% confidence interval.\n\n\nQ2: As we could see from the formulas for confidence intervals, sample means and their confidence intervals depend on the sample size. We can change the sample size in the online app (see the setting underneath the vizualization). By default, the sample size is set to 5. Change the sample size to 50 (you can type it in). Which statement is true?\n\n\nThe larger the sample size, the larger the confidence intervals. The sample size does not influence how the sample means vary around the true population mean. The larger the sample size, the smaller the confidence intervals. The sample size does not influence how the sample means vary around the true population mean.The larger the sample size, the larger the confidence intervals, and the closer the sample means are to the true population mean.The larger the sample size, the smaller the confidence intervals, and the closer the sample means are to the true population mean.\n\n\nQ3: In the forest plot below, we see the effect size (indicated by the square) and the confidence interval of the effect size (indicated by the line around the effect). Which of the studies 1 to 4 in the forest plot below were statistically significant?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.10: Meta-analysis of 4 studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudies 1, 2, 3, and 4Only study 3None of the four studiesStudies 1, 2 and 4\n\n\nQ4: The light black diamond in the bottom row is the fixed effects meta-analytic effect size estimate. Instead of using a black horizontal line, the upper limit and lower limit of the confidence interval are indicated by the left and right points of the diamond. The center of the diamond is the meta-analytic effect size estimate. A meta-analysis calculates the effect size by combining and weighing all studies. Which statement is true?\n\n\nThe confidence interval for a fixed effect meta-analytic effect size estimate is always wider than that for a single study, because of the additional variation between studies.The confidence interval for a fixed effect meta-analytic effect size estimate is always more narrow than that for a single study, because of the combined sample size of all studies included in the meta-analysis.The confidence interval for a fixed effect meta-analytic effect size estimate does not become wider or more narrow compared to the confidence interval of a single study, it just becomes closer to the true population parameter.\n\n\nQ5: Let’s assume a researcher calculates a mean of 7.5, and a standard deviation of 6.3, in a sample of 20 people. The critical value for a t-distribution with df = 19 is 2.093. Calculate the upper limit of the confidence interval around the mean using the formula below. Is it:\n\\[\n\\mu \\pm t_{df, 1-(\\alpha/2)} SE\n\\]\n\n\n1.402.958.9110.45\n\n\nCopy the code below into R and run the code. It will generate plots like the one in Figure 7.4. Run the entire script as often as you want (notice the variability in the p-values due to the relatively low power in the test!), to answer the following question. The p-value in the plot will tell you if the difference is statistically significant, and what the p-value is. Run the simulation until you find a p-value close to p = 0.05.\n\nx &lt;- rnorm(n = 50, mean = 3, sd = 5) # get sample group 1\ny &lt;- rnorm(n = 50, mean = 5, sd = 5) # get sample group 2\n\nd &lt;- data.frame(\n  labels = c(\"X\", \"Y\", \"Difference\"),\n  mean = c(mean(x), mean(y), mean(y) - mean(x)),\n  lower = c(t.test(x)[[4]][1], t.test(y)[[4]][1], t.test(y, x)[[4]][1]),\n  upper = c(t.test(x)[[4]][2], t.test(y)[[4]][2], t.test(y, x)[[4]][2])\n)\n\nplot(NA, xlim = c(.5, 3.5), ylim = c(0, max(d$upper[1:2] + 1)), bty = \"l\", \n     xaxt = \"n\", xlab = \"\", ylab = \"Mean\")\npoints(d$mean[1:2], pch = 19)\nsegments(1, d$mean[1], 5, d$mean[1], lty = 2)\nsegments(2, d$mean[2], 5, d$mean[2], lty = 2)\naxis(1, 1:3, d$labels)\nsegments(1:2, d$lower[1:2], 1:2, d$upper[1:2])\naxis(4, seq((d$mean[1] - 3), (d$mean[1] + 5), by = 1), seq(-3, 5, by = 1))\npoints(3, d$mean[1] + d$mean[3], pch = 19, cex = 1.5)\nsegments(3, d$mean[1] + d$lower[3], 3, d$mean[1] + d$upper[3], lwd = 2)\nmtext(\"Difference\", side = 4, at = d$mean[1], line = 3)\nsegments(1:1, d$upper[1:1], 1:2, d$upper[1:1], lty = 3)\nsegments(1:1, d$lower[1:2], 1:2, d$lower[1:2], lty = 3)\ntext(3, 1, paste(\"P-value\", round(t.test(x, y)$p.value, digits = 3)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ6: How much do two 95% confidence intervals around individual means from independent groups overlap when the mean difference between the two means is only just statistically significant (p ≈ 0.05 at an alpha of 0.05)?\n\n\nWhen the 95% confidence interval around one mean does not contain the mean of the other group, the groups always differ significantly from each other.When the 95% confidence interval around one mean does not overlap with the 95% confidence interval of the mean of the other group, the groups always differ significantly from each other.When the overlap between the two confidence intervals around each mean overlap a little bit (the upper bound of the CI overlaps with the lower quarter of the confidence interval around the other mean) the groups differ significantly from each other at approximately p = 0.05.There is no relationship between the overlap of the 95% confidence intervals around two independent means, and the p-value for the difference between these groups.\n\n\nNote that this visual overlap rule can only be used when the comparison is made between independent groups, not between dependent groups! The 95% confidence interval around effect sizes is therefore typically more easily interpretable in relation to the significance of a test.\nLet’s experience this through simulation. The simulation in the R script below generates a large number of additional samples, after the initial one that was plotted. The simulation returns the number of CI that contains the mean (which should be 95% in the long run). The simulation also returns the % of means from future studies that fall within the 95% of the original study, or the capture percentage. It differs from (and is often lower, but sometimes higher, than) the confidence interval.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nn &lt;- 20 # set sample size\nnsims &lt;- 100000 # set number of simulations\n\nx &lt;- rnorm(n = n, mean = 100, sd = 15) # create sample from normal distribution\n\n# 95% Confidence Interval\nciu &lt;- mean(x) + qt(0.975, df = n - 1) * sd(x) * sqrt(1 / n)\ncil &lt;- mean(x) - qt(0.975, df = n - 1) * sd(x) * sqrt(1 / n)\n\n# 95% Prediction Interval\npiu &lt;- mean(x) + qt(0.975, df = n - 1) * sd(x) * sqrt(1 + 1 / n)\npil &lt;- mean(x) - qt(0.975, df = n - 1) * sd(x) * sqrt(1 + 1 / n)\n\nggplot(as.data.frame(x), aes(x)) + # plot data\n  geom_rect(aes(xmin = pil, xmax = piu, ymin = 0, ymax = Inf),\n            fill = \"gold\") + # draw yellow PI area\n  geom_rect(aes(xmin = cil, xmax = ciu, ymin = 0, ymax = Inf),\n            fill = \"#E69F00\") + # draw orange CI area\n  geom_histogram(colour = \"black\", fill = \"grey\", aes(y = after_stat(density)), bins = 20) +\n  xlab(\"Score\") +\n  ylab(\"frequency\") +\n  theme_bw(base_size = 20) +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(x), linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(50, 150)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(seq(50, 150, 10))) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = mean(x), y = 0.02, label = paste(\n    \"Mean = \", round(mean(x)), \"\\n\",\n    \"SD = \", round(sd(x)), sep = \"\"), size = 6.5)\n\n# Simulate Confidence Intervals\nciu_sim &lt;- numeric(nsims)\ncil_sim &lt;- numeric(nsims)\nmean_sim &lt;- numeric(nsims)\n\nfor (i in 1:nsims) { # for each simulated experiment\n  x &lt;- rnorm(n = n, mean = 100, sd = 15) # create sample from normal distribution\n  ciu_sim[i] &lt;- mean(x) + qt(0.975, df = n - 1) * sd(x) * sqrt(1 / n)\n  cil_sim[i] &lt;- mean(x) - qt(0.975, df = n - 1) * sd(x) * sqrt(1 / n)\n  mean_sim[i] &lt;- mean(x) # store means of each sample\n}\n\n# Save only those simulations where the true value was inside the 95% CI\nciu_sim &lt;- ciu_sim[ciu_sim &lt; 100]\ncil_sim &lt;- cil_sim[cil_sim &gt; 100]\n\n# Calculate how many times the observed mean fell within the 95% CI of the original study\nmean_sim &lt;- mean_sim[mean_sim &gt; cil & mean_sim &lt; ciu]\n\ncat((100 * (1 - (length(ciu_sim) / nsims + length(cil_sim) / nsims))),\n    \"% of the 95% confidence intervals contained the true mean\")\ncat(\"The capture percentage for the plotted study, or the % of values within\n    the observed confidence interval from\", cil, \"to\", ciu,\n    \"is:\", 100 * length(mean_sim) / nsims, \"%\")\n\nQ7: Run the simulations multiple times. Look at the output you will get in the R console. For example: “95.077 % of the 95% confidence intervals contained the true mean” and “The capture percentage for the plotted study, or the % of values within the observed confidence interval from 88.17208 to 103.1506 is: 82.377 %”. While running the simulations multiple times, look at the confidence interval around the sample mean, and relate this to the capture percentage. Run the simulation until you have seen a range of means closer and further away from the true mean in the simulation (100). Which statement is true?\n\n\nThe farther the sample mean is from the true population mean, the lower the capture percentage.The farther the sample mean is from the true population mean, the higher the capture percentage.\n\n\nQ8: Simulations in R are randomly generated, but you can make a specific simulation reproducible by setting the seed of the random generation process. Copy-paste “set.seed(1000)” to the first line of the R script, and run the simulation. The sample mean should be 94. What is the capture percentage? (Don’t forget to remove the set.seed command if you want to generate more random simulations!).\n\n\n95%42.1%84.3%89.2%\n\n\nCapture percentages are rarely directly used to make statistical inferences. The main reason we discuss them here is really to prevent the common misunderstanding that 95% of future means fall within a single confidence interval: Capture percentages clearly show that is not true. Prediction intervals are also rarely used in psychology, but are more common in data science.\nQ9: If you run lines the first lines of the code below, you will see that with an alpha level of 0.05, 100 observations, and a true standard deviation of 1, the 95% CI is [0.88; 1.16]. Change the assumed population standard deviation from 1 to 2 (st_dev &lt;- 2). Keep all other settings the same.

Lower the sample size from 100 to 20 (n &lt;- 20). This will inform us about the width of the confidence interval for a standard deviation when we run a pilot study with 20 observations. Keep all other settings the same. What is the 95% CI around the standard deviation of 1 with 20 observations?\n\n\n95% CI [0.91; 1.11]95% CI [0.82; 1.28]95% CI [0.76; 1.46]95% CI [1.52; 2.92]\n\n\nQ11: If we want the 95% CI around the standard deviation of 1 to be at most 0.05 away from the assumed population standard deviation, how large should our number of observations be? Note that this means we want the 95% CI to fall within 0.95 and 1.05. But notice from the calculations above that the distribution of the sample standard deviations is not symmetrical. Standard deviations can’t be smaller than 0 (because they are the square rooted variance). So in practice the question is: What is the smallest number of observations for the upper 95% CI to be smaller than 1.05? Replace n with each of the values in the answer options.\n\n\nn = 489n = 498n = 849n = 948\n\n\nLet’s explore what the consequences of an inaccurate estimate of the population standard deviation are on a-priori power analyses. Let’s imagine we want to perform an a-priori power analysis for a smallest effect size of interest of half a scale point (on a scale from 1-5) on a measure that has an (unknown) true population standard deviation of 1.2.\nQ12: Change the number of observations to 50. Change the assumed population standard deviation to 1.2. Keep the effect as 0.5. The 95% confidence interval for the standard deviation based on a sample of 50 observation ranges from 1.002 to 1.495. To perform an a-priori power analysis we need to calculate Cohen’s d, which is the difference divided by the standard deviation. In our example, we want to at least observe a difference of 0.5. What is Cohen’s d (effect/SD) for the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (where SD = 1.002) or the upper bound (where SD = 1.495)?\n\n\nd = 0.33 and d = 0.50d = 0.40 and d = 0.60d = 0.43 and d = 0.57d = 0.29 and d = 0.55\n\n\nIf we draw a sample of 50 observations we can happen to observe a value that, due to random variation, is much smaller or much larger than the true population value. We can examine the effect this has on the number of observations that we think will be required when we perform an a-priori power analysis.\nQ13: An a-priori power analysis is performed that uses the estimate of Cohen’s d based on the lower 95% CI of the standard deviation. Which statement is true?\n\n\nBecause the lower bound of the 95% CI is smaller than the true population SD, Cohen’s d is smaller, and the a-priori power analysis will yield a sample size that is smaller than the sample size we really need.Because the lower bound of the 95% CI is smaller than the true population SD, Cohen’s d is larger, and the a-priori power analysis will yield a sample size that is larger than the sample size we really need.Because the lower bound of the 95% CI is smaller than the true population SD, Cohen’s d is smaller, and the a-priori power analysis will yield a sample size that is larger than the sample size we really need.Because the lower bound of the 95% CI is smaller than the true population SD, Cohen’s d is larger, and the a-priori power analysis will yield a sample size that is smaller than the sample size we really need.\n\n\nQ14: Let’s check if our answer on the previous question was correct. We still have an alpha level of 0.05, n = 50, a standard deviation of 1.2, and an effect of interest of 0.5. Run the power analyses using the pwr package. The first power analysis uses Cohen’s d based on the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval. The second power analysis uses the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval. (There is also a third power analysis based on the (in real-life situations unknown) true standard deviation, just for comparison). Which statement is true (note that the sample size for a power analysis is rounded up, as we can’t collect a partial observation)?\n\n\nThe sample size per group is 68 when calculating the effect size based on the lower bound on the 95% CI around the standard deviation, and 86 when using the upper bound of the 95% CI around the standard deviation.The sample size per group is 68 when calculating the effect size based on the lower bound on the 95% CI around the standard deviation, and 123 when using the upper bound of the 95% CI around the standard deviation.The sample size per group is 86 when calculating the effect size based on the lower bound on the 95% CI around the standard deviation, and 123 when using the upper bound of the 95% CI around the standard deviation.The sample size per group is 86 when calculating the effect size based on the lower bound on the 95% CI around the standard deviation, and 189 when using the upper bound of the 95% CI around the standard deviation.\n\n\n\n\n7.11.1 Open Questions\n\nWhat is the definition of a confidence interval?\nHow is a confidence interval related to statistical significance?\nWhat happens to a confidence interval when the sample size increases?\nWhat is the difference between a confidence interval and a capture percentage?\nWhat is a prediction interval?\nIf you have data from the entire population, do you need to calculate a confidence interval?\nWhat are confidence intervals a statement about?\nWhat does it mean to say that after you have collected the data, the confidence interval either contains the true parameter, or it doesn’t?\nWhat is the difference between estimates from small vs. large samples?\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbers, C.

    "text": "8.1 Six Approaches to Justify Sample Sizes\nResearchers often find it difficult to justify their sample size (i.e., a number of participants, observations, or any combination thereof). In this review article six possible approaches are discussed that can be used to justify the sample size in a quantitative study (see Table 8.1). This is not an exhaustive overview, but it includes the most common and applicable approaches for single studies. The topic of power analysis for meta-analyses is outside the scope of this chapter, but see Hedges & Pigott (2001) and Valentine et al. (2010). The first justification is that data from (almost) the entire population has been collected. The second justification centers on resource constraints, which are almost always present, but rarely explicitly evaluated. The third and fourth justifications are based on a desired statistical power or a desired accuracy. The fifth justification relies on heuristics, and finally, researchers can choose a sample size without any justification. Each of these justifications can be stronger or weaker depending on which conclusions researchers want to draw from the data they plan to collect.\nAll of these approaches to the justification of sample sizes, even the ‘no justification’ approach, give others insight into the reasons that led to the decision for a sample size in a study. It should not be surprising that the ‘heuristics’ and ‘no justification’ approaches are often unlikely to impress peers. However, it is important to note that the value of the information that is collected depends on the extent to which the final sample size allows a researcher to achieve their inferential goals, and not on the sample size justification that is chosen.\nThe extent to which these approaches make other researchers judge the data that is collected as informative depends on the details of the question a researcher aimed to answer and the parameters they chose when determining the sample size for their study. For example, a badly performed a-priori power analysis can quickly lead to a study with very low informational value. These six justifications are not mutually exclusive, and multiple approaches can be considered when designing a study."

    "text": "8.2 Six Ways to Evaluate Which Effect Sizes are Interesting\nThe informativeness of the data that is collected depends on the inferential goals a researcher has, or in some cases, the inferential goals scientific peers will have. A shared feature of the different inferential goals considered in this review article is the question which effect sizes a researcher considers meaningful to distinguish. This implies that researchers need to evaluate which effect sizes they consider interesting. These evaluations rely on a combination of statistical properties and domain knowledge. In Table 8.2 six possibly useful considerations are provided. This is not intended to be an exhaustive overview, but it presents common and useful approaches that can be applied in practice. Not all evaluations are equally relevant for all types of sample size justifications. The online Shiny app accompanying Lakens (2022) provides researchers with an interactive form that guides researchers through the considerations for a sample size justification. These considerations often rely on the same information (e.g., effect sizes, the number of observations, the standard deviation, etc.) so these six considerations should be seen as a set of complementary approaches that can be used to evaluate which effect sizes are of interest.\nTo start, researchers should consider what their smallest effect size of interest is. Second, although only relevant when performing a hypothesis test, researchers should consider which effect sizes could be statistically significant given a choice of an alpha level and sample size. Third, it is important to consider the (range of) effect sizes that are expected. This requires a careful consideration of the source of this expectation and the presence of possible biases in these expectations. Fourth, it is useful to consider the width of the confidence interval around possible values of the effect size in the population, and whether we can expect this confidence interval to reject effects we considered a-priori plausible. Fifth, it is worth evaluating the power of the test across a wide range of possible effect sizes in a sensitivity power analysis. Sixth, a researcher can consider the effect size distribution of related studies in the literature.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.2: Overview of possible ways to evaluate which effect sizes are interesting.\n\nType of evaluation\nWhich question should a researcher ask?\n\n\n\nSmallest effect size of interest\nWhat is the smallest effect size that is considered theoretically or practically interesting?\n\n\nThe minimal statistically detectable effect\nGiven the test and sample size, what is the critical effect size that can be statistically significant?\n\n\nExpected effect size\nWhich effect size is expected based on theoretical predictions or previous research?\n\n\nWidth of confidence interval\nWhich effect sizes are excluded based on the expected width of the confidence interval around the effect size?\n\n\nSensitivity power analysis\nAcross a range of possible effect sizes, which effects does a design have sufficient power to detect when performing a hypothesis test?\n\n\nDistribution of effect sizes in a research area\nWhat is the empirical range of effect sizes in a specific research area and which effects are a priori unlikely to be observed?"

    "section": "\n8.3 The Value of Information",
    "text": "8.3 The Value of Information\nSince all scientists are faced with resource limitations, they need to balance the cost of collecting each additional datapoint against the increase in information that datapoint provides. This is referred to as the value of information (Eckermann et al., 2010). Calculating the value of information is notoriously difficult (Detsky, 1990). Researchers need to specify the cost of collecting data, and weigh the costs of data collection against the increase in utility that having access to the data provides. From a value of information perspective not every data point that can be collected is equally valuable (J. Halpern et al., 2001; Wilson, 2015). Whenever additional observations do not change inferences in a meaningful way, the costs of data collection can outweigh the benefits.\nThe value of additional information will in most cases be a non-monotonic function, especially when it depends on multiple inferential goals. A researcher might be interested in comparing an effect against a previously observed large effect in the literature, a theoretically predicted medium effect, and the smallest effect that would be practically relevant. In such a situation the expected value of sampling information will lead to different optimal sample sizes for each inferential goal. It could be valuable to collect informative data about a large effect, with additional data having less (or even a negative) marginal utility, up to a point where the data becomes increasingly informative about a medium effect size, with the value of sampling additional information decreasing once more until the study becomes increasingly informative about the presence or absence of a smallest effect of interest.\nBecause of the difficulty of quantifying the value of information, scientists typically use less formal approaches to justify the amount of data they set out to collect in a study. Even though the cost-benefit analysis is not always made explicit in reported sample size justifications, the value of information perspective is almost always implicitly the underlying framework that sample size justifications are based on. Throughout the subsequent discussion of sample size justifications, the importance of considering the value of information given inferential goals will repeatedly be highlighted."

    "section": "\n8.5 Resource Constraints",
    "text": "8.5 Resource Constraints\nA common reason for the number of observations in a study is that resource constraints limit the amount of data that can be collected at a reasonable cost (Lenth, 2001). In practice, sample sizes are always limited by the resources that are available. Researchers practically always have resource limitations, and therefore even when resource constraints are not the primary justification for the sample size in a study, it is always a secondary justification.\nDespite the omnipresence of resource limitations, the topic often receives little attention in texts on experimental design (for an example of an exception, see Bulus & Dong (2021)). This might make it feel like acknowledging resource constraints is not appropriate, but the opposite is true: Because resource limitations always play a role, a responsible scientist carefully evaluates resource constraints when designing a study. Resource constraint justifications are based on a trade-off between the costs of data collection, and the value of having access to the information the data provides. Even if researchers do not explicitly quantify this trade-off, it is revealed in their actions. For example, researchers rarely spend all the resources they have on a single study. Given resource constraints, researchers are confronted with an optimization problem of how to spend resources across multiple research questions.\nTime and money are two resource limitations all scientists face. A PhD student has a certain time to complete a PhD thesis, and is typically expected to complete multiple research lines in this time. In addition to time limitations, researchers have limited financial resources that often directly influence how much data can be collected. A third limitation in some research lines is that there might simply be a very small number of individuals from whom data can be collected, such as when studying patients with a rare disease. A resource constraint justification puts limited resources at the center of the justification for the sample size that will be collected, and starts with the resources a scientist has available. These resources are translated into an expected number of observations (N) that a researcher expects they will be able to collect with an amount of money in a given time. The challenge is to evaluate whether collecting N observations is worthwhile. How do we decide if a study will be informative, and when should we conclude that data collection is not worthwhile?\nWhen evaluating whether resource constraints make data collection uninformative, researchers need to explicitly consider which inferential goals they have when collecting data (Parker & Berman, 2003). Having data always provides more knowledge about the research question than not having data, so in an absolute sense, all data that is collected has value. However, it is possible that the benefits of collecting the data are outweighed by the costs of data collection.\nIt is most straightforward to evaluate whether data collection has value when we know for certain that someone will make a decision, with or without data. In such situations any additional data will reduce the error rates of a well-calibrated decision process, even if only ever so slightly. For example, without data we will not perform better than a coin flip if we guess which of two conditions has a higher true mean score on a measure. With some data, we can perform better than a coin flip by picking the condition that has the highest mean. With a small amount of data we would still very likely make a mistake, but the error rate is smaller than without any data. In these cases, the value of information might be positive, as long as the reduction in error rates is more beneficial than the cost of data collection.\nAnother way in which a small dataset can be valuable is if its existence eventually makes it possible to perform a meta-analysis (Maxwell & Kelley, 2011). This argument in favor of collecting a small dataset requires 1) that researchers share the data in a way that a future meta-analyst can find it, and 2) that there is a decent probability that someone will perform a high-quality meta-analysis that will include this data in the future (S. D. Halpern et al., 2002). The uncertainty about whether there will ever be such a meta-analysis should be weighed against the costs of data collection.\nOne way to increase the probability of a future meta-analysis is if researchers commit to performing this meta-analysis themselves, by combining several studies they have performed into a small-scale meta-analysis (Cumming, 2014). For example, a researcher might plan to repeat a study for the next 12 years in a class they teach, with the expectation that after 12 years a meta-analysis of 12 studies would be sufficient to draw informative inferences (but see ter Schure & Grünwald (2019)). If it is not plausible that a researcher will collect all the required data by themselves, they can attempt to set up a collaboration where fellow researchers in their field commit to collecting similar data with identical measures. If it is not likely that sufficient data will emerge over time to reach the inferential goals, there might be no value in collecting the data.\nEven if a researcher believes it is worth collecting data because a future meta-analysis will be performed, they will most likely perform a statistical test on the data. To make sure their expectations about the results of such a test are well-calibrated, it is important to consider which effect sizes are of interest, and to perform a sensitivity power analysis to evaluate the probability of a Type II error for effects of interest. From the six ways to evaluate which effect sizes are interesting that will be discussed in the second part of this review, it is useful to consider the smallest effect size that can be statistically significant, the expected width of the confidence interval around the effect size, and effects that can be expected in a specific research area, and to evaluate the power for these effect sizes in a sensitivity power analysis. If a decision or claim is made, a compromise power analysis is worthwhile to consider when deciding upon the error rates while planning the study. When reporting a resource constraints sample size justification it is recommended to address the five considerations in Table 8.3). Addressing these points explicitly facilitates evaluating if the data is worthwhile to collect. To make it easier to address all relevant points explicitly, an interactive form to implement the recommendations in this chapter can be found at https://shiny.ieis.tue.nl/sample_size_justification/.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.3: Overview of recommendations when reporting a sample size justification based on resource constraints.\n\nWhat to address\nHow to address it?\n\n\n\nWill a future meta-analysis be performed?\nConsider the plausibility that sufficient highly similar studies will be performed in the future to make a meta-analysis possible.\n\n\nWill a decision or claim be made regardless of the amount of data that is available?\nIf a decision is made then any data that is collected will reduce errorates.

    "section": "\n8.6 A-priori Power Analysis",
    "text": "8.6 A-priori Power Analysis\nWhen designing a study where the goal is to test whether a statistically significant effect is present, researchers often want to make sure their sample size is large enough to prevent erroneous conclusions for a range of effect sizes they care about. In this approach to justifying a sample size, the value of information is to collect observations up to the point that the probability of an erroneous inference is, in the long run, not larger than a desired value. If a researcher performs a hypothesis test, there are four possible outcomes:\n\nA false positive (or Type I error), determined by the \\(\\alpha\\) level. A test yields a significant result, even though the null hypothesis is true.\nA false negative (or Type II error), determined by \\(\\beta\\), or 1 - power. A test yields a non-significant result, even though the alternative hypothesis is true.\nA true negative, determined by 1-\\(\\alpha\\). A test yields a non-significant result when the null hypothesis is true.\nA true positive, determined by 1-\\(\\beta\\). A test yields a significant result when the alternative hypothesis is true.\n\nGiven a specified effect size, alpha level, and power, an a-priori power analysis can be used to calculate the number of observations required to achieve the desired error rates, given the effect size. Power analyses can be performed based on standardized effect sizes or effect sizes expressed on the original scale. It is important to know the standard deviation of the effect (see the ‘Know Your Measure’ section) but I find it slightly more convenient to talk about standardized effects in the context of sample size justifications. Figure 8.1 illustrates how the statistical power increases as the number of observations (per group) increases in an independent t test with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. If we are interested in detecting an effect of d = 0.5, a sample size of 90 per condition would give us more than 90% power. Statistical power can be computed to determine the number of participants, or the number of items (Westfall et al., 2014) but can also be performed for single case studies (Ferron & Onghena, 1996; McIntosh & Rittmo, 2021).\nAlthough it is common to set the Type I error rate to 5% and aim for 80% power, error rates should be justified (Lakens, Adolfi, et al., 2018). As explained in the section on compromise power analysis, the default recommendation to aim for 80% power lacks a solid justification. In general, the lower the error rates (and thus the higher the power), the more informative a study will be, but the more resources are required. Researchers should carefully weigh the costs of increasing the sample size against the benefits of lower error rates, which would probably make studies designed to achieve a power of 90% or 95% more common for articles reporting a single study. An additional consideration is whether the researcher plans to publish an article consisting of a set of replication and extension studies, in which case the probability of observing multiple Type I errors will be very low, but the probability of observing mixed results even when there is a true effect increases (Lakens & Etz, 2017), which would also be a reason to aim for studies with low Type II error rates, perhaps even by slightly increasing the alpha level for each individual study.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Power curve for an independent t test with an effect of d = 0.5 and α = 0.05 as a function of the sample size.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2 visualizes two distributions. The left distribution (dashed line) is centered at 0. This is a model for the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is true a statistically significant result will be observed if the effect size is extreme enough (in a two-sided test either in the positive or negative direction), but any significant result would be a Type I error (the dark grey areas under the curve). If there is no true effect, formally statistical power for a null hypothesis significance test is undefined. Any significant effects observed if the null hypothesis is true are Type I errors, or false positives, which occur at the chosen alpha level. The right distribution (solid line) is centered on an effect of d = 0.5. This is the specified model for the alternative hypothesis in this study, illustrating the expectation of an effect of d = 0.5 if the alternative hypothesis is true. Even though there is a true effect, studies will not always find a statistically significant result. This happens when, due to random variation, the observed effect size is too close to 0 to be statistically significant. Such results are false negatives (the light grey area under the curve on the right). To increase power, we can collect a larger sample size. As the sample size increases, the distributions become more narrow, reducing the probability of a Type II error. These figures can be reproduced and adapted in an online shiny app.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Null (d = 0, grey dashed line) and alternative (d = 0.5, solid black line) hypothesis, with α = 0.05 and n = 80 per group.\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to highlight that the goal of an a-priori power analysis is not to achieve sufficient power for the true effect size. The true effect size is unknown. The goal of an a-priori power analysis is to achieve sufficient power, given a specific assumption of the effect size a researcher wants to detect. Just like a Type I error rate is the maximum probability of making a Type I error conditional on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, an a-priori power analysis is computed under the assumption of a specific effect size. It is unknown if this assumption is correct. All a researcher can do is to make sure their assumptions are well justified. Statistical inferences based on a test where the Type II error rate is controlled are conditional on the assumption of a specific effect size. They allow the inference that, assuming the true effect size is at least as large as that used in the a-priori power analysis, the maximum Type II error rate in a study is not larger than a desired value.\nThis point is perhaps best illustrated if we consider a study where an a-priori power analysis is performed both for a test of the presence of an effect, as for a test of the absence of an effect. When designing a study, it essential to consider the possibility that there is no effect (e.g., a mean difference of zero). An a-priori power analysis can be performed both for a null hypothesis significance test, as for a test of the absence of a meaningful effect, such as an equivalence test that can statistically provide support for the null hypothesis by rejecting the presence of effects that are large enough to matter (Lakens, 2017; Meyners, 2012; Rogers et al., 1993). When multiple primary tests will be performed based on the same sample, each analysis requires a dedicated sample size justification. If possible, a sample size is collected that guarantees that all tests are informative, which means that the collected sample size is based on the largest sample size returned by any of the a-priori power analyses.\nFor example, if the goal of a study is to detect or reject an effect size of d = 0.4 with 90% power, and the alpha level is set to 0.05 for a two-sided independent t test, a researcher would need to collect 133 participants in each condition for an informative null hypothesis test, and 136 participants in each condition for an informative equivalence test. Therefore, the researcher should aim to collect 272 (that is, 136 participants in each condition) participants in total for an informative result for both tests that are planned. This does not guarantee a study has sufficient power for the true effect size (which can never be known), but it guarantees the study has sufficient power given an assumption of the effect a researcher is interested in detecting or rejecting. Therefore, an a-priori power analysis is useful, as long as a researcher can justify the effect sizes they are interested in.\nIf researchers correct the alpha level when testing multiple hypotheses, the a-priori power analysis should be based on this corrected alpha level. For example, if four tests are performed, an overall Type I error rate of 5% is desired, and a Bonferroni correction is used, the a-priori power analysis should be based on a corrected alpha level of .0125.\nAn a-priori power analysis can be performed analytically or by performing computer simulations. Analytic solutions are faster but less flexible. A common challenge researchers face when attempting to perform power analyses for more complex or uncommon tests is that available software does not offer analytic solutions. In these cases simulations can provide a flexible solution to perform power analyses for any test (Morris et al., 2019). The following code is an example of a power analysis in R based on 10000 simulations for a one-sample t test against zero for a sample size of 20, assuming a true effect of d = 0.5. All simulations consist of first randomly generating data based on assumptions of the data generating mechanism (e.g., a normal distribution with a mean of 0.5 and a standard deviation of 1), followed by a test performed on the data. By computing the percentage of significant results, power can be computed for any design.\n\np &lt;- numeric(10000)   # to store p-values\nfor (i in 1:10000) {  # simulate 10k tests\n  x &lt;- rnorm(n = 20, mean = 0.5, sd = 1)\n  p[i] &lt;- t.test(x)$p.value # store p-value\n}\nsum(p &lt; 0.05) / 10000 # Compute power\n\nThere is a wide range of tools available to perform power analyses. Whichever tool a researcher decides to use, it will take time to learn how to use the software correctly to perform a meaningful a-priori power analysis. Resources to educate psychologists about power analysis consist of book-length treatments (Aberson, 2019; Cohen, 1988; Julious, 2004; Murphy et al., 2014), general introductions (Baguley, 2004; Brysbaert, 2019; Faul et al., 2007; Maxwell et al., 2008; Perugini et al., 2018), and an increasing number of applied tutorials for specific tests (Brysbaert & Stevens, 2018; DeBruine & Barr, 2021; P. Green & MacLeod, 2016; Kruschke, 2013; Lakens & Caldwell, 2021; Schoemann et al., 2017; Westfall et al., 2014). It is important to be trained in the basics of power analysis, and it can be extremely beneficial to learn how to perform simulation-based power analyses. At the same time, it is often recommended to enlist the help of an expert, especially when a researcher lacks experience with a power analysis for a specific test.\nWhen reporting an a-priori power analysis, make sure that the power analysis is completely reproducible. If power analyses are performed in R it is possible to share the analysis script and information about the version of the package. In many software packages it is possible to export the power analysis that is performed as a PDF file. For example, in G*Power analyses can be exported under the ‘protocol of power analysis’ tab. If the software package provides no way to export the analysis, add a screenshot of the power analysis to the supplementary files.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: All details about the power analysis that is performed can be exported in G*Power.\n\n\n\n\nThe reproducible report needs to be accompanied by justifications for the choices that were made with respect to the values used in the power analysis. If the effect size used in the power analysis is based on previous research, the factors presented in Table 8.5 (if the effect size is based on a meta-analysis) or Table 8.6 (if the effect size is based on a single study) should be discussed. If an effect size estimate is based on the existing literature, provide a full citation, and preferably a direct quote from the article where the effect size estimate is reported. If the effect size is based on a smallest effect size of interest, this value should not just be stated, but justified (e.g., based on theoretical predictions or practical implications, see Lakens, Scheel, et al. (2018)). For an overview of all aspects that should be reported when describing an a-priori power analysis, see Table 8.4.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.4: Overview of recommendations when reporting an a-priori power analysis.\n\nWhat to take into account?\nHow to take it into account?\n\n\n\nList all primary analyses that are planned.\nSpecify all planned primary analyses that test hypotheses for which Type I and Type II error rates should be controlled.\n\n\nSpecify the alpha level for each analysis.\nList and justify the Type I error rate for each analysis.

    "section": "\n8.7 Planning for Precision",
    "text": "8.7 Planning for Precision\nSome researchers have suggested to justify sample sizes based on a desired level of precision of the estimate (Cumming & Calin-Jageman, 2016; Kruschke, 2018; Maxwell et al., 2008). The goal when justifying a sample size based on precision is to collect data to achieve a desired width of the confidence interval around a parameter estimate. The width of the confidence interval around the parameter estimate depends on the standard deviation and the number of observations. The only aspect a researcher needs to justify for a sample size justification based on accuracy is the desired width of the confidence interval with respect to their inferential goal, and their assumption about the population standard deviation of the measure.\nIf a researcher has determined the desired accuracy, and has a good estimate of the true standard deviation of the measure, it is straightforward to calculate the sample size needed for a desired level of accuracy. For example, when measuring the IQ of a group of individuals a researcher might desire to estimate the IQ score within an error range of 2 IQ points for 95% of the observed means, in the long run. The required sample size to achieve this desired level of accuracy (assuming normally distributed data) can be computed by:\n\\[N = \\left(\\frac{z \\cdot sd}{error}\\right)^2\\]\nwhere N is the number of observations, z is the critical value related to the desired confidence interval, sd is the standard deviation of IQ scores in the population, and error is the width of the confidence interval within which the mean should fall, with the desired error rate. In this example, (1.96 × 15 / 2)^2 = 216.1 observations. If a researcher desires 95% of the means to fall within a 2 IQ point range around the true population mean, 217 observations should be collected. If a desired accuracy for a non-zero mean difference is computed, accuracy is based on a non-central t-distribution. For these calculations, an expected effect size estimate needs to be provided, but it has relatively little influence on the required sample size (Maxwell et al., 2008). It is also possible to incorporate uncertainty about the observed effect size in the sample size calculation, known as assurance (Kelley & Rausch, 2006). The MBESS package in R provides functions to compute sample sizes for a wide range of tests (Kelley, 2007).\nWhat is less straightforward is to justify how a desired level of accuracy is related to inferential goals. There is no literature that helps researchers to choose a desired width of the confidence interval. Morey (2020) convincingly argues that most practical use-cases of planning for precision involve an inferential goal of distinguishing an observed effect from other effect sizes (for a Bayesian perspective, see Kruschke (2018)). For example, a researcher might expect an effect size of r = 0.4 and would treat observed correlations that differ more than 0.2 (i.e., 0.2 &lt; r &lt; 0.6) differently, in that effects of r = 0.6 or larger are considered too large to be caused by the assumed underlying mechanism (Hilgard, 2021), while effects smaller than r = 0.2 are considered too small to support the theoretical prediction. If the goal is indeed to get an effect size estimate that is precise enough so that two effects can be differentiated with high probability, the inferential goal is actually a hypothesis test, which requires designing a study with sufficient power to reject effects (e.g., testing a range prediction of correlations between 0.2 and 0.6).\nIf researchers do not want to test a hypothesis, for example because they prefer an estimation approach over a testing approach, then in the absence of clear guidelines that help researchers to justify a desired level of precision, one solution might be to rely on a generally accepted norm of precision. This norm could be based on ideas about a certain resolution below which measurements in a research area no longer lead to noticeably different inferences. Just as researchers normatively use an alpha level of 0.05, they could plan studies to achieve a desired confidence interval width around the observed effect that is determined by a norm. Future work is needed to help researchers choose a confidence interval width when planning for accuracy (see also the section on which confidence interval to use in Bayesian tests of range predictions)."

    "section": "\n8.8 Heuristics",
    "text": "8.8 Heuristics\nWhen a researcher uses a heuristic, they are not able to justify their sample size themselves, but they trust in a sample size recommended by some authority. When I started as a PhD student in 2005 it was common to collect 15 participants in each between subject condition. When asked why this was a common practice, no one was really sure, but people trusted that there was a justification somewhere in the literature. Now, I realize there was no justification for the heuristics we used. As Berkeley (1735) already observed: “Men learn the elements of science from others: And every learner hath a deference more or less to authority, especially the young learners, few of that kind caring to dwell long upon principles, but inclining rather to take them upon trust: And things early admitted by repetition become familiar: And this familiarity at length passeth for evidence.”\nSome papers provide researchers with simple rules of thumb about the sample size that should be collected. Such papers clearly fill a need, and are cited a lot, even when the advice in these articles is flawed. For example, Wilson VanVoorhis & Morgan (2007) translate an absolute minimum of 50+8 observations for regression analyses suggested by a rule of thumb examined in S. B. Green (1991) into the recommendation to collect ~50 observations. Green actually concludes in his article that “In summary, no specific minimum number of subjects or minimum ratio of subjects-to-predictors was supported”. He does discuss how a general rule of thumb of N = 50 + 8 provided an accurate minimum number of observations for the ‘typical’ study in the social sciences because these have a ‘medium’ effect size, as Green claims by citing Cohen (1988). Cohen actually didn’t claim that the typical study in the social sciences has a ‘medium’ effect size, and instead said (1988, p. 13): “Many effects sought in personality, social, and clinical-psychological research are likely to be small effects as here defined”. We see how a string of mis-citations eventually leads to a misleading rule of thumb.\nRules of thumb seem to primarily emerge due to mis-citations and/or overly simplistic recommendations. Simonsohn, Nelson, and Simmons (2011) recommended that “Authors must collect at least 20 observations per cell”. A later recommendation by the same authors presented at a conference suggested to use n &gt; 50, unless you study large effects (Simmons et al., 2013). Regrettably, this advice is now often mis-cited as a justification to collect no more than 50 observations per condition without considering the expected effect size. If authors justify a specific sample size (e.g., n = 50) based on a general recommendation in another paper, either they are mis-citing the paper, or the paper they are citing is flawed.\nAnother common heuristic is to collect the same number of observations as were collected in a previous study. This strategy is not recommended in scientific disciplines with widespread publication bias, and/or where novel and surprising findings from largely exploratory single studies are published. Using the same sample size as a previous study is only a valid approach if the sample size justification in the previous study also applies to the current study. Instead of stating that you intend to collect the same sample size as an earlier study, repeat the sample size justification, and update it in light of any new information (such as the effect size in the earlier study, see Table 8.6).\nPeer reviewers and editors should carefully scrutinize rules of thumb sample size justifications, because they can make it seem like a study has high informational value for an inferential goal even when the study will yield uninformative results. Whenever one encounters a sample size justification based on a heuristic, ask yourself: ‘Why is this heuristic used?’ It is important to know what the logic behind a heuristic is to determine whether the heuristic is valid for a specific situation. In most cases, heuristics are based on weak logic, and not widely applicable. That said, it might be possible that fields develop valid heuristics for sample size justifications. For example, it is possible that a research area reaches widespread agreement that effects smaller than d = 0.3 are too small to be of interest, and all studies in a field use sequential designs (see below) that have 90% power to detect a d = 0.3. Alternatively, it is possible that a field agrees that data should be collected with a desired level of accuracy, irrespective of the true effect size. In these cases, valid heuristics would exist based on generally agreed goals of data collection. For example, Simonsohn (2015) suggests to design replication studies that have 2.5 times as large sample sizes as the original study, as this provides 80% power for an equivalence test against an equivalence bound set to the effect the original study had 33% power to detect, assuming the true effect size is 0. As original authors typically do not specify which effect size would falsify their hypothesis, the heuristic underlying this ‘small telescopes’ approach is a good starting point for a replication study with the inferential goal to reject the presence of an effect as large as was described in an earlier publication. It is the responsibility of researchers to gain the knowledge to distinguish valid heuristics from mindless heuristics, and to be able to evaluate whether a heuristic will yield an informative result given the inferential goal of the researchers in a specific study, or not."

    "text": "8.9 No Justification\nIt might sound like a contradictio in terminis, but it is useful to distinguish a final category where researchers explicitly state they do not have a justification for their sample size. Perhaps the resources were available to collect more data, but they were not used. A researcher could have performed a power analysis, or planned for precision, but they did not. In those cases, instead of pretending there was a justification for the sample size, honesty requires you to state there is no sample size justification. This is not necessarily bad. It is still possible to discuss the smallest effect size of interest, the minimal statistically detectable effect, the width of the confidence interval around the effect size, and to plot a sensitivity power analysis, in relation to the sample size that was collected. If a researcher truly had no specific inferential goals when collecting the data, such an evaluation can perhaps be performed based on reasonable inferential goals peers would have when they learn about the existence of the collected data.\nDo not try to spin a story where it looks like a study was highly informative when it was not. Instead, transparently evaluate how informative the study was given effect sizes that were of interest, and make sure that the conclusions follow from the data. The lack of a sample size justification might not be problematic, but it might mean that a study was not informative for most effect sizes of interest, which makes it especially difficult to interpret non-significant effects, or estimates with large uncertainty."

Therefore, to design an informative study, researchers will want to think about which effect sizes are interesting. First, it is useful to consider three effect sizes when determining the sample size. The first is the smallest effect size a researcher is interested in, the second is the smallest effect size that can be statistically significant (only in studies where a significance test will be performed), and the third is the effect size that is expected. Beyond considering these three effect sizes, it can be useful to evaluate ranges of effect sizes. This can be done by computing the width of the expected confidence interval around an effect size of interest (for example, an effect size of zero), and examine which effects could be rejected. Similarly, it can be useful to plot a sensitivity curve and evaluate the range of effect sizes the design has decent power to detect, as well as to consider the range of effects for which the design has low power. Finally, there are situations where it is useful to consider a range of effects that is likely to be observed in a specific research area."

    "text": "8.11 What is the Smallest Effect Size of Interest?\nThe strongest possible sample size justification is based on an explicit statement of the smallest effect size that is considered interesting. The smallest effect size of interest can be based on theoretical predictions or practical considerations. For a review of approaches that can be used to determine the smallest effect size of interest in randomized controlled trials, see Cook et al. (2014) and Keefe et al. (2013), for reviews of different methods to determine a smallest effect size of interest, see King (2011) and Copay et al. (2007), and for a discussion focused on psychological research, see Lakens, Scheel, et al. (2018).\nIt can be challenging to determine the smallest effect size of interest whenever theories are not very developed, or when the research question is far removed from practical applications, but it is still worth thinking about which effects would be too small to matter. A first step forward is to discuss which effect sizes are considered meaningful in a specific research line with your peers. Researchers will differ in the effect sizes they consider large enough to be worthwhile (Murphy et al., 2014). Just as not every scientist will find every research question interesting enough to study, not every scientist will consider the same effect sizes interesting enough to study, and different stakeholders will differ in which effect sizes are considered meaningful (Kelley & Preacher, 2012).\nEven though it might be challenging, there are important benefits of being able to specify the smallest effect size of interest. The population effect size is always uncertain (indeed, estimating this is typically one of the goals of the study), and therefore whenever a study is powered for an expected effect size, there is considerable uncertainty about whether the statistical power is high enough to detect the true effect in the population. However, if the smallest effect size of interest can be specified and agreed upon after careful deliberation, it becomes possible to design a study that has sufficient power (given the inferential goal to detect or reject the smallest effect size of interest with a certain error rate). Put differently, although the smallest effect of interest may be subjective (one researcher might find effect sizes smaller than d = 0.3 meaningless, while another researcher might still be interested in effects smaller than d = 0.1), and there might be uncertainty about the parameters required to specify the smallest effect size of interest (e.g., when performing a cost-benefit analysis), once researchers determine the smallest effect size of interest, a study can be designed with a known Type II error rate to detect or reject this value. For this reason an a-priori power based on a smallest effect size of interest is generally preferred, whenever researchers are able to specify one (Aberson, 2019; Albers & Lakens, 2018; Brown, 1983; Cascio & Zedeck, 1983; Dienes, 2014; Lenth, 2001)."

    "section": "\n8.12 The Minimal Statistically Detectable Effect",
    "text": "8.12 The Minimal Statistically Detectable Effect\nThe minimal statistically detectable effect, or the critical effect size, provides information about the smallest effect size that, if observed, would be statistically significant given a specified alpha level and sample size (Cook et al., 2014). For any critical t value (e.g., t = 1.96 for \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05, for large sample sizes) we can compute a critical mean difference (Phillips et al., 2001), or a critical standardized effect size. For a two-sided independent t test the critical mean difference is:\n\\[M_{crit} = t_{crit}{\\sqrt{\\frac{sd_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{sd_2^2}{n_2}}}\\]\nand the corresponding critical standardized mean difference is:\n\\[d_{crit} = t_{crit}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}}\\]\nIn Figure 8.4, the distribution of Cohen’s d is plotted for 15 participants per group when the true effect size is either d = 0 or d = 0.5. This figure is similar to Figure 8.2, with the addition that the critical d is indicated. We see that with such a small number of observations in each group only observed effects larger than d = 0.75 will be statistically significant. Whether such effect sizes are interesting, and can realistically be expected, should be carefully considered and justified.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Critical effect size for an independent t test with n = 15 per group and \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05.\n\n\n\n\nG*Power provides the critical test statistic (such as the critical t value) when performing a power analysis. For example, Figure 8.5 shows that for a correlation based on a two-sided test, with \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05, and N = 30, only effects larger than r = 0.361 or smaller than r = -0.361 can be statistically significant. This reveals that when the sample size is relatively small, the observed effect needs to be quite substantial to be statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: The critical correlation of a test based on a total sample size of 30 and α = 0.05 calculated in G*Power.\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to realize that due to random variation each study has a probability to yield effects larger than the critical effect size, even if the true effect size is small (or even when the true effect size is 0, in which case each significant effect is a Type I error). Computing a minimal statistically detectable effect is useful for a study where no a-priori power analysis is performed, both for studies in the published literature that do not report a sample size justification (Lakens, Scheel, et al., 2018), as for researchers who rely on heuristics for their sample size justification.\nIt can be informative to ask yourself whether the critical effect size for a study design is within the range of effect sizes that can realistically be expected. If not, then whenever a significant effect is observed in a published study, either the effect size is surprisingly larger than expected, or more likely, it is an upwardly biased effect size estimate. In the latter case, given publication bias, published studies will lead to biased effect size estimates. If it is still possible to increase the sample size, for example by ignoring rules of thumb and instead performing an a-priori power analysis, then do so. If it is not possible to increase the sample size, for example due to resource constraints, then reflecting on the minimal statistically detectable effect should make it clear that an analysis of the data should not focus on p values, but on the effect size and the confidence interval (see Table 8.3).\nIt is also useful to compute the minimal statistically detectable effect if an ‘optimistic’ power analysis is performed. For example, if you believe a best case scenario for the true effect size is d = 0.57 and use this optimistic expectation in an a-priori power analysis, effects smaller than d = 0.4 will not be statistically significant when you collect 50 observations in a two independent group design. If your worst case scenario for the alternative hypothesis is a true effect size of d = 0.35 your design would not allow you to declare a significant effect if effect size estimates close to the worst case scenario are observed. Taking into account the minimal statistically detectable effect size should make you reflect on whether a hypothesis test will yield an informative answer, and whether your current approach to sample size justification (e.g., the use of rules of thumb, or letting resource constraints determine the sample size) leads to an informative study, or not."

Even if expectations for the observed effect size are largely a guess, it is always useful to explicitly consider which effect sizes are expected. A researcher can justify a sample size based on the effect size they expect, even if such a study would not be very informative with respect to the smallest effect size of interest. In such cases a study is informative for one inferential goal (testing whether the expected effect size is present or absent), but not highly informative for the second goal (testing whether the smallest effect size of interest is present or absent).\nThere are typically three sources for expectations about the population effect size: a meta-analysis, a previous study, or a theoretical model. It is tempting for researchers to be overly optimistic about the expected effect size in an a-priori power analysis, as higher effect size estimates yield lower sample sizes, but being too optimistic increases the probability of observing a false negative result.

    "text": "8.14 Using an Estimate from a Meta-Analysis\nIn a perfect world effect size estimates from a meta-analysis would provide researchers with the most accurate information about which effect size they could expect. Due to widespread publication bias in science, effect size estimates from meta-analyses are regrettably not always accurate. They can be biased, sometimes substantially so. Furthermore, meta-analyses typically have considerable heterogeneity, which means that the meta-analytic effect size estimate differs for subsets of studies that make up the meta-analysis. So, although it might seem useful to use a meta-analytic effect size estimate of the effect you are studying in your power analysis, you need to take great care before doing so.\nIf a researcher wants to enter a meta-analytic effect size estimate in an a-priori power analysis, they need to consider three things (see Table 8.5). First, the studies included in the meta-analysis should be similar enough to the study they are performing that it is reasonable to expect a similar effect size. In essence, this requires evaluating the generalizability of the effect size estimate to the new study. It is important to carefully consider differences between the meta-analyzed studies and the planned study, with respect to the manipulation, the measure, the population, and any other relevant variables.\nSecond, researchers should check whether the effect sizes reported in the meta-analysis are homogeneous. If there is substantial heterogeinity in the meta-analytic effect sizes, it means not all included studies can be expected to have the same true effect size estimate. A meta-analytic estimate should be used based on the subset of studies that most closely represent the planned study. Note that heterogeneity remains a possibility (even direct replication studies can show heterogeneity when unmeasured variables moderate the effect size in each sample (Kenny & Judd, 2019; Olsson-Collentine et al., 2020)), so the main goal of selecting similar studies is to use existing data to increase the probability that your expectation is accurate, without guaranteeing it will be.\nThird, the meta-analytic effect size estimate should not be biased. Check if the bias detection tests that are reported in the meta-analysis are state-of-the-art, or perform multiple bias detection tests yourself (Carter et al., 2019), and consider bias corrected effect size estimates (even though these estimates might still be biased, and do not necessarily reflect the true population effect size).\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.5: Overview of recommendations when justifying the use of a meta-analytic effect size estimate for a power analysis.\n\nWhat to take into account\nHow to take it into account?\n\n\n\nAre the studies in the meta-analysis similar?\nAre the studies in the meta-analyses very similar in design, measures, and the population to the study you are planning?

If so, use the meta-analytic effect size estimate of the most relevant homogenous subsample.\n\n\nIs the effect size estimate unbiased?\nDid the original study report bias detection tests, and was there bias? If so, it might be wise to use a more conservative effect size estimate, based on bias correction techniques while acknowledging these corrected effect size estimates might not represent the true meta-analytic effect size estimate."

    "section": "\n8.15 Using an Estimate from a Previous Study",
    "text": "8.15 Using an Estimate from a Previous Study\nIf a meta-analysis is not available, researchers often rely on an effect size from a previous study in an a-priori power analysis. The first issue that requires careful attention is whether the two studies are sufficiently similar. Just as when using an effect size estimate from a meta-analysis, researchers should consider if there are differences between the studies in terms of the population, the design, the manipulations, the measures, or other factors that should lead one to expect a different effect size. For example, intra-individual reaction time variability increases with age, and therefore a study performed on older participants should expect a smaller standardized effect size than a study performed on younger participants. If an earlier study used a very strong manipulation, and you plan to use a more subtle manipulation, a smaller effect size should be expected. Finally, effect sizes do not generalize to studies with different designs. For example, the effect size for a comparison between two groups is most often not similar to the effect size for an interaction in a follow-up study where a second factor is added to the original design (Lakens & Caldwell, 2021).\nEven if a study is sufficiently similar, statisticians have warned against using effect size estimates from small pilot studies in power analyses. Leon, Davis, and Kraemer (2011) write:\n\nContrary to tradition, a pilot study does not provide a meaningful effect size estimate for planning subsequent studies due to the imprecision inherent in data from small samples.\n\nThe two main reasons researchers should be careful when using effect sizes from studies in the published literature in power analyses is that effect size estimates from studies can differ from the true population effect size due to random variation, and that publication bias inflates effect sizes. Figure 8.6 shows the distribution for \\(\\eta_p^2\\) for a study with three conditions with 25 participants in each condition when the null hypothesis is true (dotted grey curve) and when there is a ‘medium’ true effect of \\(\\eta_p^2\\) = 0.0588 [solid black curve; Richardson (2011)]. As in Figure 8.4 the critical effect size is indicated, which shows observed effects smaller than \\(\\eta_p^2\\) = 0.08 will not be significant with the given sample size. If the null hypothesis is true, effects larger than \\(\\eta_p^2\\) = 0.08 will be a Type I error (the dark grey area), and when the alternative hypothesis is true effects smaller than \\(\\eta_p^2\\) = 0.08 will be a Type II error (light grey area). It is clear all significant effects are larger than the true effect size (\\(\\eta_p^2\\) = 0.0588), so power analyses based on a significant finding (e.g., because only significant results are published in the literature) will be based on an overestimate of the true effect size, introducing bias.\nBut even if we had access to all effect sizes (e.g., from pilot studies you have performed yourself) due to random variation the observed effect size will sometimes be quite small. Figure 8.6 shows it is quite likely to observe an effect of \\(\\eta_p^2\\) = 0.01 in a small pilot study, even when the true effect size is 0.0588. Entering an effect size estimate of \\(\\eta_p^2\\) = 0.01 in an a-priori power analysis would suggest a total sample size of 957 observations to achieve 80% power in a follow-up study. If researchers only follow up on pilot studies when they observe an effect size in the pilot study that, when entered into a power analysis, yields a sample size that is feasible to collect for the follow-up study, these effect size estimates will be upwardly biased, and power in the follow-up study will be systematically lower than desired (Albers & Lakens, 2018).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.6: Distribution of partial eta squared under the null hypothesis (dotted grey curve) and a medium true effect of 0.0588 (solid black curve) for 3 groups with 25 observations.\n\n\n\n\nIn essence, the problem with using small studies to estimate the effect size that will be entered into an a-priori power analysis is that due to publication bias or follow-up bias the effect sizes researchers end up using for their power analysis do not come from a full F distribution, but from what is known as a truncated F distribution (Taylor & Muller, 1996). For example, imagine if there is extreme publication bias in the situation illustrated in Figure 8.6. The only studies that would be accessible to researchers would come from the part of the distribution where \\(\\eta_p^2\\) &gt; 0.08, and the test result would be statistically significant. It is possible to compute an effect size estimate that, based on certain assumptions, corrects for bias. For example, imagine we observe a result in the literature for a One-Way ANOVA with 3 conditions, reported as F(2, 42) = 0.017, \\(\\eta_p^2\\) = 0.176. If we would take this effect size at face value and enter it as our effect size estimate in an a-priori power analysis, the suggested sample size to achieve 80% power would suggest we need to collect 17 observations in each condition.\nHowever, if we assume bias is present, we can use the BUCSS R package (Anderson et al., 2017) to perform a power analysis that attempts to correct for bias. In the example above, a power analysis that takes bias into account (under a specific model of publication bias, based on a truncated F distribution where only significant results are published) suggests collecting 73 participants in each condition instead. It is possible that the bias corrected estimate of the non-centrality parameter used to compute power is zero, in which case it is not possible to correct for bias using this method. As an alternative to formally modeling a correction for publication bias whenever researchers assume an effect size estimate is biased, researchers can simply use a more conservative effect size estimate, for example by computing power based on the lower limit of a 60% two-sided confidence interval around the effect size estimate, which Perugini et al. (2014) refer to as safeguard power. Both these approaches lead to a more conservative power analysis, but not necessarily a more accurate power analysis. It is simply not possible to perform an accurate power analysis on the basis of an effect size estimate from a study that might be biased and/or had a small sample size (Teare et al., 2014). If it is not possible to specify a smallest effect size of interest, and there is great uncertainty about which effect size to expect, it might be more efficient to perform a study with a sequential design (discussed below).\nTo summarize, an effect size from a previous study in an a-priori power analysis can be used if three conditions are met (see Table 8.6). First, the previous study is sufficiently similar to the planned study. Second, there was a low risk of bias (e.g., the effect size estimate comes from a Registered Report, or from an analysis for which results would not have impacted the likelihood of publication). Third, the sample size is large enough to yield a relatively accurate effect size estimate, based on the width of a 95% CI around the observed effect size estimate. There is always uncertainty around the effect size estimate, and entering the upper and lower limit of the 95% CI around the effect size estimate might be informative about the consequences of the uncertainty in the effect size estimate for an a-priori power analysis.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.6: Overview of recommendations when justifying the use of an effect size estimate from a single study.\n\nWhat to take into account\nHow to take it into account?\n\n\n\nIs the study sufficiently similar?\nConsider if there are differences between the studies in terms of the population, the design, the manipulations, the measures, or other factors that should lead one to expect a different effect size.\n\n\nIs there a risk of bias?\nEvaluate the possibility that if the effect size estimate had been smaller you would not have used it (or it would not have been published). Examine the difference when entering the reported, and a bias corrected, effect size estimate in a power analysis.\n\n\nHow large is the uncertainty?\nStudies with a small number of observations have large uncertainty. Consider the possibility of using a more conservative effect size estimate to reduce the possibility of an underpowered study for the true effect size (such as a safeguard power analysis)."

For example, if one had strong ideas about the weights for each feature stimuli share and differ on, it could be possible to compute predicted similarity judgments for pairs of stimuli based on Tversky’s contrast model (Tversky, 1977), and estimate the predicted effect size for differences between experimental conditions. Although computational models that make point predictions are relatively rare, whenever they are available, they provide a strong justification of the effect size a researcher expects."

    "text": "8.17 Compute the Width of the Confidence Interval around the Effect Size\nIf a researcher can estimate the standard deviation of the observations that will be collected, it is possible to compute an a-priori estimate of the width of the 95% confidence interval around an effect size (Kelley, 2007). Confidence intervals represent a range around an estimate that is wide enough so that in the long run the true population parameter will fall inside the confidence intervals 100 - \\(\\alpha\\) percent of the time. In any single study the true population effect either falls in the confidence interval, or it doesn’t, but in the long run one can act as if the confidence interval includes the true population effect size (while keeping the error rate in mind). Cumming (2013) calls the difference between the observed effect size and the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (or the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval) the margin of error.\nIf we compute the 95% CI for an effect size of d = 0 based on the t statistic and sample size (Smithson, 2003), we see that with 15 observations in each condition of an independent t test the 95% CI ranges from d = -0.716 to d = 0.716. Confidence intervals around effect sizes can be computed using the MOTE Shiny app: https://www.aggieerin.com/shiny-server/. The margin of error is half the width of the 95% CI, 0.716. A Bayesian estimator who uses an uninformative prior would compute a credible interval with the same (or a very similar) upper and lower bound (Albers et al., 2018; Kruschke, 2011), and might conclude that after collecting the data they would be left with a range of plausible values for the population effect that is too large to be informative. Regardless of the statistical philosophy you plan to rely on when analyzing the data, the evaluation of what we can conclude based on the width of our interval tells us that with 15 observation per group we will not learn a lot.\nOne useful way of interpreting the width of the confidence interval is based on the effects you would be able to reject if the true effect size is 0. In other words, if there is no effect, which effects would you have been able to reject given the collected data, and which effect sizes would not be rejected, if there was no effect? Effect sizes in the range of d = 0.7 are findings such as “People become aggressive when they are provoked”, “People prefer their own group to other groups”, and “Romantic partners resemble one another in physical attractiveness” (Richard et al., 2003). The width of the confidence interval tells you that you can only reject the presence of effects that are so large, if they existed, you would probably already have noticed them. If it is true that most effects that you study are realistically much smaller than d = 0.7, there is a good possibility that we do not learn anything we didn’t already know by performing a study with n = 15. Even without data, in most research lines we would not consider certain large effects plausible (although the effect sizes that are plausible differ between fields, as discussed below). On the other hand, in large samples where researchers can for example reject the presence of effects larger than d = 0.2, if the null hypothesis was true, this analysis of the width of the confidence interval would suggest that peers in many research lines would likely consider the study to be informative.\nWe see that the margin of error is almost, but not exactly, the same as the minimal statistically detectable effect (d = 0.748). The small variation is due to the fact that the 95% confidence interval is calculated based on the t distribution. If the true effect size is not zero, the confidence interval is calculated based on the non-central t distribution, and the 95% CI is asymmetric. Figure 8.7 visualizes three t distributions, one symmetric at 0, and two asymmetric distributions with a noncentrality parameter (the normalized difference between the means) of 2 and 3. The asymmetry is most clearly visible in very small samples (the distributions in the plot have 5 degrees of freedom) but remains noticeable in larger samples when calculating confidence intervals and statistical power. For example, for a true effect size of d = 0.5 observed with 15 observations per group would yield \\(d_s\\) = 0.50, 95% CI [-0.23, 1.22]. If we compute the 95% CI around the critical effect size, we would get \\(d_s\\) = 0.75, 95% CI [0.00, 1.48]. We see the 95% CI ranges from exactly 0 to 1.484, in line with the relation between a confidence interval and a p value, where the 95% CI excludes zero if the test is statistically significant. As noted before, the different approaches recommended here to evaluate how informative a study is are often based on the same information.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.7: Central (black dashed line) and 2 non-central (dark grey and light grey dashed lines) t distributions; ncp = noncentrality parameter."

    "text": "8.18 Plot a Sensitivity Power Analysis\nA sensitivity power analysis fixes the sample size, desired power, and alpha level, and answers the question which effect size a study could detect with a desired power. A sensitivity power analysis is therefore performed when the sample size is already known. Sometimes data has already been collected to answer a different research question, or the data is retrieved from an existing database, and you want to perform a sensitivity power analysis for a new statistical analysis. Other times, you might not have carefully considered the sample size when you initially collected the data, and want to reflect on the statistical power of the study for (ranges of) effect sizes of interest when analyzing the results. Finally, it is possible that the sample size will be collected in the future, but you know that due to resource constraints the maximum sample size you can collect is limited, and you want to reflect on whether the study has sufficient power for effects that you consider plausible and interesting (such as the smallest effect size of interest, or the effect size that is expected).\nAssume a researcher plans to perform a study where 30 observations will be collected in total, 15 in each between participant condition. Figure 8.8 shows how to perform a sensitivity power analysis in G*Power for a study where we have decided to use an alpha level of 5%, and desire 90% power. The sensitivity power analysis reveals the designed study has 90% power to detect effects of at least d = 1.23. Perhaps a researcher believes that a desired power of 90% is quite high, and is of the opinion that it would still be interesting to perform a study if the statistical power was lower. It can then be useful to plot a sensitivity curve across a range of smaller effect sizes.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.8: Sensitivity power analysis in G*Power software.\n\n\n\n\nThe two dimensions of interest in a sensitivity power analysis are the effect sizes, and the power to observe a significant effect assuming a specific effect size. Fixing the sample size, these two dimensions can be plotted against each other to create a sensitivity curve. For example, a sensitivity curve can be plotted in G*Power by clicking the ‘X-Y plot for a range of values’ button, as illustrated in Figure 8.9. Researchers can examine which power they would have for an a-priori plausible range of effect sizes, or they can examine which effect sizes would provide reasonable levels of power. In simulation-based approaches to power analysis, sensitivity curves can be created by performing the power analysis for a range of possible effect sizes. Even if 50% power is deemed acceptable (in which case deciding to act as if the null hypothesis is true after a non-significant result is a relatively noisy decision procedure), Figure 8.9 shows a study design where power is extremely low for a large range of effect sizes that are reasonable to expect in most fields. Thus, a sensitivity power analysis provides an additional approach to evaluate how informative the planned study is, and can inform researchers that a specific design is unlikely to yield a significant effect for a range of effects that one might realistically expect.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.9: Plot of the effect size against the desired power when n = 15 per group and alpha = 0.05.\n\n\n\n\nIf the number of observations per group had been larger, the evaluation might have been more positive. We might not have had any specific effect size in mind, but if we had collected 150 observations per group, a sensitivity analysis could have shown that power was sufficient for a range of effects we believe is most interesting to examine, and we would still have approximately 50% power for quite small effects. For a sensitivity analysis to be meaningful, the sensitivity curve should be compared against a smallest effect size of interest, or a range of effect sizes that are expected. A sensitivity power analysis has no clear cut-offs to examine (Bacchetti, 2010). Instead, the idea is to make a holistic trade-off between different effect sizes one might observe or care about, and their associated statistical power."

    "text": "8.19 The Distribution of Effect Sizes in a Research Area\nIn my personal experience the most commonly entered effect size estimate in an a-priori power analysis for an independent t test is Cohen’s benchmark for a ‘medium’ effect size, because of what is known as the default effect. When you open G*Power, a ‘medium’ effect is the default option for an a-priori power analysis. Cohen’s benchmarks for small, medium, and large effects should not be used in an a-priori power analysis (Cook et al., 2014; Correll et al., 2020), and Cohen regretted having proposed these benchmarks (Funder & Ozer, 2019). The large variety in research topics means that any ‘default’ or ‘heuristic’ that is used to compute statistical power is not just unlikely to correspond to your actual situation, but it is also likely to lead to a sample size that is substantially misaligned with the question you are trying to answer with the collected data.\nSome researchers have wondered what a better default would be, if researchers have no other basis to decide upon an effect size for an a-priori power analysis. Brysbaert (2019) recommends d = 0.4 as a default in psychology, which is the average observed in replication projects and several meta-analyses. It is impossible to know if this average effect size is realistic, but it is clear there is huge heterogeneity across fields and research questions. Any average effect size will often deviate substantially from the effect size that should be expected in a planned study. Some researchers have suggested to change Cohen’s benchmarks based on the distribution of effect sizes in a specific field (Bosco et al., 2015; Funder & Ozer, 2019; Hill et al., 2008; Kraft, 2020; Lovakov & Agadullina, 2021). As always, when effect size estimates are based on the published literature, one needs to evaluate the possibility that the effect size estimates are inflated due to publication bias. Due to the large variation in effect sizes within a specific research area, there is little use in choosing a large, medium, or small effect size benchmark based on the empirical distribution of effect sizes in a field to perform a power analysis.\nHaving some knowledge about the distribution of effect sizes in the literature can be useful when interpreting the confidence interval around an effect size. If in a specific research area almost no effects are larger than the value you could reject in an equivalence test (e.g., if the observed effect size is 0, the design would only reject effects larger than for example d = 0.7), then it is a-priori unlikely that collecting the data would tell you something you didn’t already know.\nIt is more difficult to defend the use of a specific effect size derived from an empirical distribution of effect sizes as a justification for the effect size used in an a-priori power analysis. One might argue that the use of an effect size benchmark based on the distribution of effects in the literature will outperform a wild guess, but this is not a strong enough argument to form the basis of a sample size justification. There is a point where researchers need to admit they are not ready to perform an a-priori power analysis due to a lack of clear expectations (Scheel et al., 2021). Alternative sample size justifications, such as a justification of the sample size based on resource constraints, perhaps in combination with a sequential study design, might be more in line with the actual inferential goals of a study."

    "text": "8.20 Additional Considerations When Designing an Informative Study\nSo far, the focus has been on justifying the sample size for quantitative studies. There are a number of related topics that can be useful to design an informative study. First, in addition to a-priori or prospective power analysis and sensitivity power analysis, it is important to discuss compromise power analysis (which is useful) and post-hoc or retrospective power analysis (which is not useful, e.g., Zumbo & Hubley (1998), Lenth (2007)). When sample sizes are justified based on an a-priori power analysis it can be very efficient to collect data in sequential designs where data collection is continued or terminated based on interim analyses of the data. Furthermore, it is worthwhile to consider ways to increase the power of a test without increasing the sample size. An additional point of attention is to have a good understanding of your dependent variable, especially it’s standard deviation. Finally, sample size justification is just as important in qualitative studies, and although there has been much less work on sample size justification in this domain, some proposals exist that researchers can use to design an informative study. Each of these topics is discussed in turn."

    "section": "\n8.21 Compromise Power Analysis",
    "text": "8.21 Compromise Power Analysis\nIn a compromise power analysis the sample size and the effect are fixed, and the error rates of the test are calculated, based on a desired ratio between the Type I and Type II error rate. A compromise power analysis is useful both when a very large number of observations will be collected, as when only a small number of observations can be collected.\nIn the first situation a researcher might be fortunate enough to be able to collect so many observations that the statistical power for a test is very high for all effect sizes that are deemed interesting. For example, imagine a researcher has access to 2000 employees who are all required to answer questions during a yearly evaluation in a company where they are testing an intervention that should reduce subjectively reported stress levels. You are quite confident that an effect smaller than d = 0.2 is not large enough to be subjectively noticeable for individuals (Jaeschke et al., 1989). With an alpha level of 0.05 the researcher would have a statistical power of 0.994, or a Type II error rate of 0.006. This means that for the smallest effect size of interest of d = 0.2 the researcher is 8.3 times more likely to make a Type I error than a Type II error.\nAlthough the original idea of designing studies that control Type I and Type II error rates was that researchers would need to justify their error rates (Neyman & Pearson, 1933), a common heuristic is to set the Type I error rate to 0.05 and the Type II error rate to 0.20, meaning that a Type I error is 4 times as unlikely as a Type II error. This default use of 80% power (or a Type II error rate/\\(\\beta\\) of 0.20) is based on a personal preference of Cohen (1988), who writes:\n\nIt is proposed here as a convention that, when the investigator has no other basis for setting the desired power value, the value .80 be used. This means that \\(\\beta\\) is set at .20. This arbitrary but reasonable value is offered for several reasons (Cohen, 1965, pp. 98-99). The chief among them takes into consideration the implicit convention for \\(\\alpha\\) of .05. The \\(\\beta\\) of .20 is chosen with the idea that the general relative seriousness of these two kinds of errors is of the order of .20/.05, i.e., that Type I errors are of the order of four times as serious as Type II errors. This .80 desired power convention is offered with the hope that it will be ignored whenever an investigator can find a basis in his substantive concerns in his specific research investigation to choose a value ad hoc.\n\nWe see that conventions are built on conventions: the norm to aim for 80% power is built on the norm to set the alpha level at 5%. What we should take away from Cohen is not that we should aim for 80% power, but that we should justify our error rates based on the relative seriousness of each error. This is where compromise power analysis comes in. If you share Cohen’s belief that a Type I error is 4 times as serious as a Type II error, and building on our earlier study on 2000 employees, it makes sense to adjust the Type I error rate when the Type II error rate is low for all effect sizes of interest (Cascio & Zedeck, 1983). Indeed, Erdfelder et al. (1996) created the G*Power software in part to give researchers a tool to perform compromise power analysis.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.10: Compromise power analysis in G*Power.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.10 illustrates how a compromise power analysis is performed in G*Power when a Type I error is deemed to be equally costly as a Type II error (that is, when the \\(\\beta/\\alpha\\) ratio = 1), which for a study with 1000 observations per condition would lead to a Type I error and a Type II error of 0.0179. As Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, and Buchner (2007) write:\n\nOf course, compromise power analyses can easily result in unconventional significance levels greater than \\(\\alpha\\) = .05 (in the case of small samples or effect sizes) or less than \\(\\alpha\\) = .001 (in the case of large samples or effect sizes). However, we believe that the benefit of balanced Type I and Type II error risks often offsets the costs of violating significance level conventions.\n\nThis brings us to the second situation where a compromise power analysis can be useful, which is when we know the statistical power in our study is low. Although it is highly undesirable to make decisions when error rates are high, if one finds oneself in a situation where a decision must be made based on little information, Winer (1962) writes:\n\nThe frequent use of the .05 and .01 levels of significance is a matter of convention having little scientific or logical basis. When the power of tests is likely to be low under these levels of significance, and when Type I and Type II errors are of approximately equal importance, the .30 and .20 levels of significance may be more appropriate than the .05 and .01 levels.\n\nFor example, if we plan to perform a two-sided t test, can feasibly collect at most 50 observations in each independent group, and expect a population effect size of 0.5, we would have 70% power if we set our alpha level to 0.05. Alternatively, using compromise power analysis, we can choose to weigh both types of error equally (\\(\\beta/\\alpha\\) ratio = 1) by setting both the alpha level and Type II error rate to 0.149. Doing so, we would have 85.10% power to detect the expected population effect size of d = 0.5 instead. The choice of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) in a compromise power analysis can be extended to take prior probabilities of the null and alternative hypothesis into account (Maier & Lakens, 2022; Miller & Ulrich, 2019; Murphy et al., 2014).\nA compromise power analysis requires a researcher to specify the sample size. This sample size itself requires a justification, so a compromise power analysis will typically be performed together with a resource constraint justification for a sample size. It is especially important to perform a compromise power analysis if your resource constraint justification is strongly based on the need to make a decision, in which case a researcher should think carefully about the Type I and Type II error rates stakeholders are willing to accept. However, a compromise power analysis also makes sense if the sample size is very large, but a researcher did not have the freedom to set the sample size. This might happen if, for example, data collection is part of a larger international study and the sample size is based on other research questions. In designs where the Type II error rate is very small (and power is very high) some statisticians have also recommended to lower the alpha level to prevent Lindley’s paradox, a situation where a significant effect (p &lt; \\(\\alpha\\)) is evidence for the null hypothesis (Good, 1992; Jeffreys, 1939). Lowering the alpha level as a function of the statistical power of the test can prevent this paradox, providing another argument for a compromise power analysis when sample sizes are large (Maier & Lakens, 2022). Finally, a compromise power analysis needs a justification for the effect size, either based on a smallest effect size of interest or an effect size that is expected. Table 8.7 lists three aspects that should be discussed alongside a reported compromise power analysis.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.7: Overview of recommendations when justifying error rates based on a compromise power analysis.\n\nWhat to take into account\nHow to take it into account?\n\n\n\nWhat is the justification for the sample size?\nSpecify why a specific sample size is collected (e.g., based on resource constraints or other factors that determined the sample size).\n\n\nWhat is the justification for the effect size?\nIs the effect size based on a smallest effect size of interest or an expected effect size?\n\n\nWhat is the desired ratio of Type I vs Type II error rates?\nWeigh the relative costs of a Type I and a Type II error by carefully evaluating the consequences of each type of error."

    "section": "\n8.22 What to do if Your Editor Asks for Post-hoc Power?",
    "text": "8.22 What to do if Your Editor Asks for Post-hoc Power?\nPost-hoc, retrospective, or observed power is used to describe the statistical power of the test that is computed assuming the effect size that has been estimated from the collected data is the true effect size (Lenth, 2007; Zumbo & Hubley, 1998). Post-hoc power is therefore not performed before looking at the data, based on effect sizes that are deemed interesting, as in an a-priori power analysis, and it is unlike a sensitivity power analysis where a range of interesting effect sizes is evaluated. Because a post-hoc or retrospective power analysis is based on the effect size observed in the data that has been collected, it does not add any information beyond the reported p value, but it presents the same information in a different way. Despite this fact, editors and reviewers often ask authors to perform post-hoc power analysis to interpret non-significant results. This is not a sensible request, and whenever it is made, you should not comply with it. Instead, you should perform a sensitivity power analysis, and discuss the power for the smallest effect size of interest and a realistic range of expected effect sizes.\nPost-hoc power is directly related to the p value of the statistical test (Hoenig & Heisey, 2001). For a z test where the p value is exactly 0.05, post-hoc power is always 50%. The reason for this relationship is that when a p value is observed that equals the alpha level of the test (e.g., 0.05), the observed z score of the test is exactly equal to the critical value of the test (e.g., z = 1.96 in a two-sided test with a 5% alpha level). Whenever the alternative hypothesis is centered on the critical value half the values we expect to observe if this alternative hypothesis is true fall below the critical value, and half fall above the critical value. Therefore, a test where we observed a p value identical to the alpha level will have exactly 50% power in a post-hoc power analysis, as the analysis assumes the observed effect size is true.\nFor other statistical tests, where the alternative distribution is not symmetric (such as for the t test, where the alternative hypothesis follows a non-central t distribution, see Figure 8.7), a p = 0.05 does not directly translate to an observed power of 50%, but by plotting post-hoc power against the observed p value we see that the two statistics are always directly related. As Figure 8.11 shows, if the p value is non-significant (i.e., larger than 0.05) the observed power will be less than approximately 50% in a t test. Lenth (2007) explains how observed power is also completely determined by the observed p value for F tests, although the statement that a non-significant p value implies a power less than 50% no longer holds.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.11: Relationship between p values and power for an independent t test with α = 0.05 and n = 10.\n\n\n\n\nWhen editors or reviewers ask researchers to report post-hoc power analyses they would like to be able to distinguish between true negatives (concluding there is no effect, when there is no effect) and false negatives (a Type II error, concluding there is no effect, when there actually is an effect). Since reporting post-hoc power is just a different way of reporting the p value, reporting the post-hoc power will not provide an answer to the question editors are asking (Hoenig & Heisey, 2001; Lenth, 2007; Schulz & Grimes, 2005; Yuan & Maxwell, 2005). To be able to draw conclusions about the absence of a meaningful effect, one should perform an equivalence test, and design a study with high power to reject the smallest effect size of interest. Alternatively, if no smallest effect size of interest was specified when designing the study, researchers can report a sensitivity power analysis."

    "text": "8.23 Sequential Analyses\nWhenever the sample size is justified based on an a-priori power analysis it can be very efficient to collect data in a sequential design. Sequential designs control error rates across multiple looks at the data (e.g., after 50, 100, and 150 observations have been collected) and can reduce the average expected sample size that is collected compared to a fixed design where data is only analyzed after the maximum sample size is collected (Proschan et al., 2006; Wassmer & Brannath, 2016). Sequential designs have a long history (Dodge & Romig, 1929), and exist in many variations, such as the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (Wald, 1945), combining independent statistical tests (Westberg, 1985), group sequential designs (Jennison & Turnbull, 2000), sequential Bayes factors (Schönbrodt et al., 2017), and safe testing (Grünwald et al., 2019). Of these approaches, the Sequential Probability Ratio Test is most efficient if data can be analyzed after every observation (Schnuerch & Erdfelder, 2020). Group sequential designs, where data is collected in batches, provide more flexibility in data collection, error control, and corrections for effect size estimates (Wassmer & Brannath, 2016). Safe tests provide optimal flexibility if there are dependencies between observations (ter Schure & Grünwald, 2019).\nSequential designs are especially useful when there is considerable uncertainty about the effect size, or when it is plausible that the true effect size is larger than the smallest effect size of interest the study is designed to detect (Lakens, 2014). In such situations data collection has the possibility to terminate early if the effect size is larger than the smallest effect size of interest, but data collection can continue to the maximum sample size if needed. Sequential designs can prevent waste when testing hypotheses, both by stopping early when the null hypothesis can be rejected, as by stopping early if the presence of a smallest effect size of interest can be rejected (i.e., stopping for futility). Group sequential designs are currently the most widely used approach to sequential analyses, and can be planned and analyzed using rpact or gsDesign. Shiny apps are available for both rpact and gsDesign."

    "section": "\n8.24 Increasing Power Without Increasing the Sample Size",
    "text": "8.24 Increasing Power Without Increasing the Sample Size\nThe most straightforward approach to increase the informational value of studies is to increase the sample size. Because resources are often limited, it is also worthwhile to explore different approaches to increasing the power of a test without increasing the sample size. The first option is to use directional tests where relevant. Researchers often make directional predictions, such as ‘we predict X is larger than Y’. The statistical test that logically follows from this prediction is a directional (or one-sided) t test. A directional test moves the Type I error rate to one side of the tail of the distribution, which lowers the critical value, and therefore requires less observations to achieve the same statistical power.\nAlthough there is some discussion about when directional tests are appropriate, they are perfectly defensible from a Neyman-Pearson perspective on hypothesis testing (Cho & Abe, 2013), which makes a (preregistered) directional test a straightforward approach to both increase the power of a test, as the riskiness of the prediction. However, there might be situations where you do not want to ask a directional question. Sometimes, especially in research with applied consequences, it might be important to examine if a null effect can be rejected, even if the effect is in the opposite direction as predicted. For example, when you are evaluating a recently introduced educational intervention, and you predict the intervention will increase the performance of students, you might want to explore the possibility that students perform worse, to be able to recommend abandoning the new intervention. In such cases it is also possible to distribute the error rate in a ‘lop-sided’ manner, for example assigning a stricter error rate to effects in the negative than in the positive direction (Rice & Gaines, 1994).\nAnother approach to increase the power without increasing the sample size, is to increase the alpha level of the test, as explained in the section on compromise power analysis. Obviously, this comes at an increased probability of making a Type I error. The risk of making either type of error should be carefully weighed, which typically requires taking into account the prior probability that the null hypothesis is true (Cascio & Zedeck, 1983; Miller & Ulrich, 2019; Mudge et al., 2012; Murphy et al., 2014). If you have to make a decision, or want to make a claim, and the data you can feasibly collect is limited, increasing the alpha level is justified, either based on a compromise power analysis, or based on a cost-benefit analysis (Baguley, 2004; Field et al., 2004).\nAnother widely recommended approach to increase the power of a study is use a within participant design where possible. In almost all cases where a researcher is interested in detecting a difference between groups, a within participant design will require collecting less participants than a between participant design. The reason for the decrease in the sample size is explained by the equation below from Maxwell et al. (2017). The number of participants needed in a two group within-participants design (NW) relative to the number of participants needed in a two group between-participants design (NB), assuming normal distributions, is:\n\\[NW = \\frac{NB (1-\\rho)}{2}\\]\nThe required number of participants is divided by two because in a within-participants design with two conditions every participant provides two data points. The extent to which this reduces the sample size compared to a between-participants design also depends on the correlation between the dependent variables (e.g., the correlation between the measure collected in a control task and an experimental task), as indicated by the (1-\\(\\rho\\)) part of the equation. If the correlation is 0, a within-participants design simply needs half as many participants as a between participant design (e.g., 64 instead 128 participants). The higher the correlation, the larger the relative benefit of within-participants designs, and whenever the correlation is negative (up to -1) the relative benefit disappears.\nIn Figure 8.12 we see two normally distributed scores with a mean difference of 6, where the standard deviation of each mean is 15, and the correlation between the measurements is 0. The standard deviation of the difference score is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) times as large as the standard deviation in each measurement, and indeed, 15×\\(\\sqrt{2}\\) = 21.21, which is rounded to 21. This situation where the correlation between measurements is zero equals the situation in an independent t-test, where the correlation between measurements is not taken into account.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.12: Distributions of two dependent groups with means 100 and 106 and a standard deviation of 15, distribution of the differences, and correlation of 0.\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 8.13 we can see what happens when the two variables are correlated, for example with r = 0.7. Nothing has changed when we plot the means. The correlation between measurements is now strongly positive, and the important difference is in the standard deviation of the difference scores, which is 11 instead of 21 in the uncorrelated example. Because the standardized effect size is the difference divided by the standard deviation, the effect size (Cohen’s \\(d_z\\) in within designs) is larger in this test than in the uncorrelated test.\n\n\nCoordinate system already present. Adding new coordinate system, which will\nreplace the existing one.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.13: Distributions of two independent groups with means 100 and 106 and a standard deviation of 15, distribution of the differences, and correlation of 0.7.\n\n\n\n\nThe correlation between dependent variables is an important aspect of within designs. I recommend explicitly reporting the correlation between dependent variables in within designs (e.g., participants responded significantly slower (M = 390, SD = 44) when they used their feet than when they used their hands (M = 371, SD = 44, r = .953), t(17) = 5.98, p &lt; 0.001, Hedges’ g = 0.43, \\(M_{diff}\\) = 19, 95% CI [12; 26]). Since most dependent variables in within designs in psychology are positively correlated, within designs will increase the power you can achieve given the sample size you have available. Use within-designs when possible, but weigh the benefits of higher power against the downsides of order effects or carryover effects that might be problematic in a within-subject design (Maxwell et al., 2017).\nYou can use this Shiny app to play around with different means, standard deviations, and correlations, and see the effect of the distribution of the difference scores.\nIn general, the smaller the variation, the larger the standardized effect size (because we are dividing the raw effect by a smaller standard deviation) and thus the higher the power given the same number of observations. Some additional recommendations are provided in the literature (Allison et al., 1997; Bausell & Li, 2002; Hallahan & Rosenthal, 1996), such as:\n\nUse better ways to screen participants for studies where participants need to be screened before participation.\nAssign participants unequally to conditions (if data in the control condition is much cheaper to collect than data in the experimental condition, for example).\nUse reliable measures that have low error variance (Williams et al., 1995).\nSmart use of preregistered covariates (Meyvis & Van Osselaer, 2018).\n\nIt is important to consider if these ways to reduce the variation in the data do not come at too large a cost for external validity. For example, in an intention-to-treat analysis in randomized controlled trials participants who do not comply with the protocol are maintained in the analysis such that the effect size from the study accurately represents the effect of implementing the intervention in the population, and not the effect of the intervention only on those people who perfectly follow the protocol (Gupta, 2011). Similar trade-offs between reducing the variance and external validity exist in other research areas."

    "section": "\n8.25 Know Your Measure",
    "text": "8.25 Know Your Measure\nAlthough it is convenient to talk about standardized effect sizes, it is generally preferable if researchers can interpret effects in the raw (unstandardized) scores, and have knowledge about the standard deviation of their measures (Baguley, 2009; Lenth, 2001). To make it possible for a research community to have realistic expectations about the standard deviation of measures they collect, it is beneficial if researchers within a research area use the same validated measures. This provides a reliable knowledge base that makes it easier to plan for a desired accuracy, and to use a smallest effect size of interest on the unstandardized scale in an a-priori power analysis.\nIn addition to knowledge about the standard deviation it is important to have knowledge about the correlations between dependent variables (for example because Cohen’s dz for a dependent t test relies on the correlation between means). The more complex the model, the more aspects of the data-generating process need to be known to make predictions. For example, in hierarchical models researchers need knowledge about variance components to be able to perform a power analysis (DeBruine & Barr, 2021; Westfall et al., 2014). Finally, it is important to know the reliability of your measure (Parsons et al., 2019), especially when relying on an effect size from a published study that used a measure with different reliability, or when the same measure is used in different populations, in which case it is possible that measurement reliability differs between populations. With the increasing availability of open data, it will hopefully become easier to estimate these parameters using data from earlier studies.\nIf we calculate a standard deviation from a sample, this value is an estimate of the true value in the population. In small samples, our estimate can be quite far off, while due to the law of large numbers, as our sample size increases, we will be measuring the standard deviation more accurately. Since the sample standard deviation is an estimate with uncertainty, we can calculate a confidence interval around the estimate (Smithson, 2003), and design pilot studies that will yield a sufficiently reliable estimate of the standard deviation. The confidence interval for the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) is provided in the following formula, and the confidence for the standard deviation is the square root of these limits:\n\\[(N - 1)s^2/\\chi^2_{N-1:\\alpha/2},(N - 1)s^2/\\chi^2_{N-1:1-\\alpha/2}\\]\nWhenever there is uncertainty about parameters, researchers can use sequential designs to perform an internal pilot study (Wittes & Brittain, 1990). The idea behind an internal pilot study is that researchers specify a tentative sample size for the study, perform an interim analysis, use the data from the internal pilot study to update parameters such as the variance of the measure, and finally update the final sample size that will be collected. As long as interim looks at the data are blinded (e.g., information about the conditions is not taken into account) the sample size can be adjusted based on an updated estimate of the variance without any practical consequences for the Type I error rate (Friede & Kieser, 2006; Proschan, 2005). Therefore, if researchers are interested in designing an informative study where the Type I and Type II error rates are controlled, but they lack information about the standard deviation, an internal pilot study might be an attractive approach to consider (Chang, 2016)."

    "text": "8.26 Conventions as meta-heuristics\nEven when a researcher might not use a heuristic to directly determine the sample size in a study, there is an indirect way in which heuristics play a role in sample size justifications. Sample size justifications based on inferential goals such as a power analysis, accuracy, or a decision all require researchers to choose values for a desired Type I and Type II error rate, a desired accuracy, or a smallest effect size of interest. Although it is sometimes possible to justify these values as described above (e.g., based on a cost-benefit analysis), a solid justification of these values might require dedicated research lines. Performing such research lines will not always be possible, and these studies might themselves not be worth the costs (e.g., it might require less resources to perform a study with an alpha level that most peers would consider conservatively low, than to collect all the data that would be required to determine the alpha level based on a cost-benefit analysis). In these situations, researchers might use values based on a convention.\nWhen it comes to a desired width of a confidence interval, a desired power, or any other input values required to perform a sample size computation, it is important to transparently report the use of a heuristic or convention (for example by using the accompanying online Shiny app). A convention such as the use of a 5% Type 1 error rate and 80% power practically functions as a lower threshold of the minimum informational value peers are expected to accept without any justification (whereas with a justification, higher error rates can also be deemed acceptable by peers). It is important to realize that none of these values are set in stone. Journals are free to specify that they desire a higher informational value in their author guidelines (e.g., Nature Human Behavior requires Registered Reports to be designed to achieve 95% statistical power, and my own department has required staff to submit ERB proposals where, whenever possible, the study was designed to achieve 90% power). Researchers who choose to design studies with a higher informational value than a conventional minimum should receive credit for doing so.\nIn the past some fields have changed conventions, such as the 5 sigma threshold now used in physics to declare a discovery instead of a 5% Type I error rate. In other fields such attempts have been unsuccessful (e.g., Johnson (2013)). Improved conventions should be context dependent, and it seems sensible to establish them through consensus meetings (Mullan & Jacoby, 1985). Consensus meetings are common in medical research, and have been used to decide upon a smallest effect size of interest (for an example, see Fried et al. (1993)). In many research areas current conventions can be improved. For example, it seems peculiar to have a default alpha level of 5% both for single studies and for meta-analyses, and one could imagine a future where the default alpha level in meta-analyses is much lower than 5%. Hopefully, making the lack of an adequate justification for certain input values in specific situations more transparent will motivate fields to start a discussion about how to improve current conventions. The online Shiny app links to good examples of justifications where possible, and will continue to be updated as better justifications are developed in the future."

    "text": "8.27 Sample Size Justification in Qualitative Research\nA value of information perspective to sample size justification also applies to qualitative research. A sample size justification in qualitative research should be based on the consideration that the cost of collecting data from additional participants does not yield new information that is valuable enough given the inferential goals. One widely used application of this idea is known as saturation and is indicated by the observation that new data replicates earlier observations, without adding new information (Morse, 1995). For example, let’s imagine we ask people why they have a pet. Interviews might reveal reasons that are grouped into categories, but after interviewing 20 people, no new categories emerge, at which point saturation has been reached. Alternative philosophies to qualitative research exist, and not all value planning for saturation. Regrettably, principled approaches to justify sample sizes have not been developed for these alternative philosophies (Marshall et al., 2013).\nWhen sampling, the goal is often not to pick a representative sample, but a sample that contains a sufficiently diverse number of subjects such that saturation is reached efficiently. Fugard and Potts (2015) show how to move towards a more informed justification for the sample size in qualitative research based on 1) the number of codes that exist in the population (e.g., the number of reasons people have pets), 2) the probability a code can be observed in a single information source (e.g., the probability that someone you interview will mention each possible reason for having a pet), and 3) the number of times you want to observe each code. They provide an R formula based on binomial probabilities to compute a required sample size to reach a desired probability of observing codes.\nA more advanced approach is used in Rijnsoever (2017), which also explores the importance of different sampling strategies. In general, purposefully sampling information from sources you expect will yield novel information is much more efficient than random sampling, but this also requires a good overview of the expected codes, and the sub-populations in which each code can be observed. Sometimes, it is possible to identify information sources that, when interviewed, would at least yield one new code (e.g., based on informal communication before an interview). A good sample size justification in qualitative research is based on 1) an identification of the populations, including any sub-populations, 2) an estimate of the number of codes in the (sub-)population, 3) the probability a code is encountered in an information source, and 4) the sampling strategy that is used."

    "section": "\n8.28 Discussion",
    "text": "8.28 Discussion\nProviding a coherent sample size justification is an essential step in designing an informative study. There are multiple approaches to justifying the sample size in a study, depending on the goal of the data collection, the resources that are available, and the statistical approach that is used to analyze the data. An overarching principle in all these approaches is that researchers consider the value of the information they collect in relation to their inferential goals.\nThe process of justifying a sample size when designing a study should sometimes lead to the conclusion that it is not worthwhile to collect the data, because the study does not have sufficient informational value to justify the costs. There will be cases where it is unlikely there will ever be enough data to perform a meta-analysis (for example because of a lack of general interest in the topic), the information will not be used to make a decision or claim, and the statistical tests do not allow you to test a hypothesis with reasonable error rates or to estimate an effect size with sufficient accuracy. If there is no good justification to collect the maximum number of observations that one can feasibly collect, performing the study anyway is a waste of time and/or money (Brown, 1983; Button et al., 2013; S. D. Halpern et al., 2002).\nThe awareness that sample sizes in past studies were often too small to meet any realistic inferential goals is growing among psychologists (Button et al., 2013; Fraley & Vazire, 2014; Lindsay, 2015; Sedlmeier & Gigerenzer, 1989). As an increasing number of journals start to require sample size justifications, some researchers will realize they need to collect larger samples than they were used to. This means researchers will need to request more money for participant payment in grant proposals, or that researchers will need to increasingly collaborate (Moshontz et al., 2018). If you believe your research question is important enough to be answered, but you are not able to answer the question with your current resources, one approach to consider is to organize a research collaboration with peers, and pursue an answer to this question collectively."

A post-hoc power analysis is mathematically identical to a sensitivity power analysis for a specific effect size estimate, and it is better to plot power for a range of effect sizes, than for a specific value.The question is whether a non-significant effect is a true negative, or a false negative, and the risk of these errors should be controlled in advance through an a-priori power analysis, not after the data is collected through a post-hoc power analysis.\n\n\nQ11: Researchers should not perform a post-hoc power analysis.

    "section": "\n9.1 Equivalence tests",
    "text": "9.1 Equivalence tests\nEquivalence tests were first developed in pharmaceutical sciences (Hauck & Anderson, 1984; Westlake, 1972) and later formalized as the two one-sided tests (TOST) approach to equivalence testing (Schuirmann, 1987; Seaman & Serlin, 1998; Wellek, 2010). The TOST procedure entails performing two one-sided tests to examine whether the observed data is surprisingly larger than a lower equivalence boundary (\\(\\Delta_{L}\\)), or surprisingly smaller than an upper equivalence boundary (\\(\\Delta_{U}\\)):\n\\[\nt_{L} = \\frac{{\\overline{M}}_{1} - {\\overline{M}}_{2} - \\Delta_{L}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_{1}} + \\frac{1}{n_{2}}}}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nt_{U} = \\frac{{\\overline{M}}_{1} - {\\overline{M}}_{2}{- \\Delta}_{U}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_{1}} + \\frac{1}{n_{2}}}}\n\\]\nwhere M indicates the means of each sample, n is the sample size, and σ is the pooled standard deviation:\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left( n_{1} - 1 \\right)\\text{sd}_{1}^{2} + \\left( n_{2} - 1 \\right)\\text{sd}_{2}^{2}}{n_{1} + \\ n_{2} - 2}}\n\\]\nIf both one-sided tests are significant, we can reject the presence of effects large enough to be meaningful. The formulas are highly similar to the normal formula for the t-statistic. The difference between a NHST t-test and the TOST procedure is that the lower equivalence boundary \\(\\Delta_{L}\\) and the upper equivalence boundary \\(\\Delta_{U}\\) are subtracted from the mean difference between groups (in a normal t-test, we compare the mean difference against 0, and thus the delta drops out of the formula because it is 0).\nTo perform an equivalence test, you don’t need to learn any new statistical tests, as it is just the well-known t-test against a different value than 0. It is somewhat surprising that the use of ttests to perform equivalence tests is not taught alongside their use in null hypothesis significance tests, as there is some indication that this could prevent common misunderstandings of p-values (Parkhurst, 2001). Let’s look at an example of an equivalence test using the TOST procedure.\nIn a study where researchers are manipulating fatigue by asking participants to carry heavy boxes around, the researchers want to ensure the manipulation does not inadvertently alter participants’ moods. The researchers assess positive and negative emotions in both conditions, and want to claim there are no differences in positive mood. Let’s assume that positive mood in the experimental fatigue condition (\\(m_1\\) = 4.55, \\(sd_1\\) = 1.05, \\(n_1\\) = 15) did not differ from the mood in the the control condition (\\(m_2\\) = 4.87, \\(sd_2\\) = 1.11, \\(n_2\\) = 15). The researchers conclude: “Mood did not differ between conditions, t = -0.81, p = .42”. Of course, mood did differ between conditions, as 4.55 - 4.87 = -0.32. The claim is that there was no meaningful difference in mood, but to make such a claim in a correct manner, we first need to specify which difference in mood is large enough to be meaningful. For now, let’s assume the researcher consider any effect less extreme half a scale point too small to be meaningful. We now test if the observed mean difference of -0.32 is small enough such that we can reject the presence of effects that are large enough to matter.\nThe TOSTER package (originally created by myself but recently redesigned by Aaron Caldwell) can be used to plot two t-distributions and their critical regions indicating when we can reject the presence of effects smaller than -0.5 and larger than 0.5. It can take some time to get used to the idea that we are rejecting values more extreme than the equivalence bounds. Try to consistently ask in any hypothesis test: Which values can the test reject? In a nil null hypothesis test, we can reject an effect of 0, and in the equivalence test in the Figure below, we can reject values lower than -0.5 and higher than 0.5. In Figure 9.2 we see two t-distributions centered on the upper and lower bound of the specified equivalence range (-0.5 and 0.5).\n\n\nSMD cannot be plotted if type = \"tnull\" \n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: The mean difference and its confidence interval plotted below the t-distributions used to perform the two-one-sided tests against -0.5 and 0.5.\n\n\n\n\nBelow the two curves we see a line that represents the confidence interval ranging from -0.99 to 0.35, and a dot on the line that indicates the observed mean difference of -0.32. Let’s first look at the left curve. We see the green highlighted area in the tails that highlights which observed mean differences would be extreme enough to statistically reject an effect of -0.5. Our observed mean difference of -0.32 lies very close to -0.5, and if we look at the left distribution, the mean is not far enough away from -0.5 to fall in the green area that indicates when observed differences would be statistically significant. We can also perform the equivalence test using the TOSTER package, and look at the results.\n\nTOSTER::tsum_TOST(m1 = 4.55, \n                  m2 = 4.87, \n                  sd1 = 1.05, \n                  sd2 = 1.11,\n                  n1 = 15, \n                  n2 = 15, \n                  low_eqbound = -0.5, \n                  high_eqbound = 0.5)\n\n\nWelch Modified Two-Sample t-Test\n\nThe equivalence test was non-significant, t(27.91) = 0.456, p = 3.26e-01\nThe null hypothesis test was non-significant, t(27.91) = -0.811, p = 4.24e-01\nNHST: don't reject null significance hypothesis that the effect is equal to zero \nTOST: don't reject null equivalence hypothesis\n\nTOST Results \n                 t    df p.value\nt-test     -0.8111 27.91   0.424\nTOST Lower  0.4563 27.91   0.326\nTOST Upper -2.0785 27.91   0.023\n\nEffect Sizes \n               Estimate     SE              C.I.

See vignette(\"SMD_calcs\").\n\n\nIn the line ‘t-test’ the output shows the traditional nil null hypothesis significance test (which we already knew was not statistically significant: t = 0.46, p = 0.42. Just like the default t-test in R, the tsum_TOST function will by default calculate Welch’s t-test (instead of Student’s t-test), which is a better default (Delacre et al., 2017), but you can request Student’s t-test by adding var.equal = TRUE as an argument to the function.\nWe also see a test indicated by TOST Lower. This is the first one-sided test examining if we can reject effects lower than -0.5. From the test result, we see this is not the case: t = 0.46, p = 0.33. This is an ordinary t-test, just against an effect of -0.5. Because we cannot reject differences more extreme than -0.5, it is possible that a difference we consider meaningful (e.g., a difference of -0.60) is present. When we look at the one-sided test against the upper bound of the equivalence range (0.5) we see that we can statistically reject the presence of mood effects larger than 0.5, as in the line TOST Upper we see t = -2.08, p = 0.02. Our final conclusion is therefore that, even though we can reject effects more extreme than 0.5 based on the observed mean difference of -0.32, we cannot reject effects more extreme than -0.5. Therefore, we cannot completely reject the presence of meaningful mood effects. As the data does not allow us to claim the effect is different from 0, nor that the effect is, if anything, too small to matter (based on an equivalence range from -0.5 to 0.5), the data are inconclusive. We cannot distinguish between a Type 2 error (there is an effect, but in this study we just did not detect it) or a true negative (there really is no effect large enough to matter).\nNote that because we fail to reject the one-sided test against the lower equivalence bound, the possibility remains that there is a true effect size that is large enough to be considered meaningful. This statement is true, even when the effect size we have observed (-0.32) is closer to zero than to the equivalence bound of -0.5. One might think the observed effect size needs to be more extreme (i.e., &lt; -0.5 or &gt; 0.5) than the equivalence bound to maintain the possibility that there is an effect that is large enough to be considered meaningful. But that is not required. The 90% CI indicates that some values below -0.5 cannot be rejected. As we can expect that 90% of confidence intervals in the long run capture the true population parameter, it is perfectly possible that the true effect size is more extreme than -0.5. And, the effect might even be more extreme than the values captured by this confidence interval, as 10% of the time, the computed confidence interval is expected to not contain the true effect size. Therefore, when we fail to reject the smallest effect size of interest, we retain the possibility that an effect of interest exists. If we can reject the nil null hypothesis, but fail to reject values more extreme than the equivalence bounds, then we can claim there is an effect, and it might be large enough to be meaningful.\nOne way to reduce the probability of an inconclusive effect is to collect sufficient data. Let’s imagine the researchers had not collected 15 participants in each condition, but 200 participants. They otherwise observe exactly the same data. As explained in the chapter on confidence intervals, as the sample size increases, the confidence interval becomes more narrow. For a TOST equivalence test to be able to reject both the upper and lower bound of the equivalence range, the confidence interval needs to fall completely within the equivalence range. In Figure 9.3 we see the same result as in Figure 9.2, but now if we had collected 200 observations. Because of the larger sample size, the confidence is more narrow than when we collected 15 participants. We see that the 90% confidence interval around the observed mean difference now excludes both the upper and lower equivalence bound. This means that we can now reject effects outside of the equivalence range (even though barely, with a p = 0.048 as the one-sided test against the lower equivalence bound is only just statistically significant).\n\n\n\nWelch Modified Two-Sample t-Test\n\nThe equivalence test was significant, t(396.78) = 1.666, p = 4.82e-02\nThe null hypothesis test was significant, t(396.78) = -2.962, p = 3.24e-03\nNHST: reject null significance hypothesis that the effect is equal to zero \nTOST: reject null equivalence hypothesis\n\nTOST Results \n                t    df p.value\nt-test     -2.962 396.8   0.003\nTOST Lower  1.666 396.8   0.048\nTOST Upper -7.590 396.8 &lt; 0.001\n\nEffect Sizes \n               Estimate    SE               C.I.

See vignette(\"SMD_calcs\").\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: The mean difference and its confidence interval for an equivalence test with an equivalence range of -0.5 and 0.5.\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 9.4 we see the the same results, but now visualized as a confidence density plot (Schweder & Hjort, 2016), which is a graphical summary of the distribution of confidence. A confidence density plot allows you to see which effects can be rejected with difference confidence interval widths. We see the bounds of the green area (corresponding to a 90% confidence interval) fall inside the equivalence bounds. Thus, the equivalence test is statistically significant, and we can statistically reject the presence of effects outside the equivalence range. We can also see that the 95% confidence interval excludes 0, and therefore, a traditional null hypothesis significance test is also statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4: The mean difference and its confidence interval for an equivalence test with an equivalence range of -0.5 and 0.5.\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, both the null hypothesis test and the equivalence test have yielded significant results. This means we can claim that the observed effect is statistically different from zero, and that the effect is statistically smaller than effects we deemed large enough to matter when we specified the equivalence range from -0.5 to 0.5. This illustrates how combining equivalence tests and nil null hypothesis tests can prevent us from mistaking statistically significant effects for practically significant effects. In this case, with 200 participants, we can reject an effect of 0, but the effect, if any, is not large enough to be meaningful."

    "section": "\n9.2 Reporting Equivalence Tests",
    "text": "9.2 Reporting Equivalence Tests\nIt is common practice to only report the test yielding the higher p-value of the two one-sided tests when reporting an equivalence test. Because both one-sided tests need to be statistically significant to reject the null hypothesis in an equivalence test (i.e., the presence of effects large enough to matter), when the larger of the two hypothesis tests rejects the equivalence bound, so does the other test. Unlike in null hypothesis significance tests it is not common to report standardized effect sizes for equivalence tests, but there can be situations where researchers might want to discuss how far the effect is removed from the equivalence bounds on the raw scale. Prevent the erroneous interpretation to claim there is ‘no effect’, that an effect is ‘absent’, that the true effect size is ‘zero’, or vague verbal descriptions, such as that two groups yielded ‘similar’ or ‘comparable’ data. A significant equivalence test rejects effects more extreme that the equivalence bounds. Smaller true effects have not been rejected, and thus it remains possible that there is a true effect. Because a TOST procedure is a frequentist test based on a p-value, all other misconceptions of p-values should be prevented as well.\nWhen summarizing the main result of an equivalence test, for example in an abstract, always report the equivalence range that the data is tested against. Reading ‘based on an equivalence test we concluded the absence of a meaningful effect’ means something very different if the equivalence bounds were d =-0.9 to 0.9 than when the bounds were d =-0.2 to d =0.2. So instead, write ‘based on an equivalence test with an equivalence range of d =-0.2 to 0.2, we conclude the absence of an effect we deemed meaningful’. Of course, whether peers agree you have correctly concluded the absence of a meaningful effect depends on whether they agree with your justification for a smallest effect of interest! A more neutral conclusion would be a statement such as: ‘based on an equivalence test, we rejected the presence of effects more extreme than -0.2 to 0.2, so we can act (with an error rate of alpha) as if the effect, if any, is less extreme than our equivalence range’. Here, you do not use value-laden terms such as ‘meaningful’. If both a null hypothesis test and an equivalence test are non-significant, the finding is best described as ‘inconclusive’: There is not enough data to reject the null, or the smallest effect size of interest. If both the null hypothesis test and the equivalence test are statistically significant, you can claim there is an effect, but at the same time claim the effect is too small to be of interest (given your justification for the equivalence range).\nEquivalence bounds can be specified in raw effect sizes, or in standardized mean differences. It is better to specify the equivalence bounds in terms of raw effect sizes. Setting them in terms of Cohen’s d leads to bias in the statistical test, as the observed standard deviation has to be used to translate the specified Cohen’s d into a raw effect size for the equivalence test (and when you set equivalence bounds in standardized mean differences, TOSTER will warn: “Warning: setting bound type to SMD produces biased results!”). The bias is in practice not too problematic in any single equivalence test, and being able to specify the equivalence bounds in standardized mean differences lowers the threshold to perform an equivalence test when they do not know the standard deviation of their measure. But as equivalence testing becomes more popular, and fields establish smallest effect sizes of interest, they should do so in raw effect size differences, not in standardized effect size differences."

    "text": "9.3 Minimum Effect Tests\nIf a researcher has specified a smallest effect size of interest, and is interested in testing whether the effect in the population is larger than this smallest effect of interest, a minimum effect test can be performed. As with any hypothesis test, we can reject the smallest effect of interest whenever the confidence interval around the observed effect does not overlap with it. In the case of a minimum effect test, however, the confidence interval should be fall completely beyond the smallest effect size of interest. For example, let’s assume a researcher performs a minimum effect test with 200 observations per condition against a smallest effect size of interest of a mean difference of 0.5.\n\n\nSMD cannot be plotted if type = \"tnull\" \n\n\n\nWelch Modified Two-Sample t-Test\n\nThe minimal effect test was significant, t(396.78) = 12.588, p = 4.71e-04\nThe null hypothesis test was significant, t(396.78) = 7.960, p = 1.83e-14\nNHST: reject null significance hypothesis that the effect is equal to zero \nTOST: reject null MET hypothesis\n\nTOST Results \n                t    df p.value\nt-test      7.960 396.8 &lt; 0.001\nTOST Lower 12.588 396.8       1\nTOST Upper  3.332 396.8 &lt; 0.001\n\nEffect Sizes \n               Estimate    SE             C.I.

The entire confidence interval lies well above the minimum effect of 0.5, and we can therefore not just reject the nil null hypothesis, but also effects smaller than the minimum effect of interest. Therefore, we can claim that the effect is large enough to be not just statistically significant, but also practically significant (as long as we have justified our smallest effect size of interest well). Because we have performed a two-sided minimum effect test, the minimum effect test would also have been significant if the confidence interval had been completely on the opposite side of -0.5.\nEarlier we discussed how combining traditional NHST and an equivalence test could lead to more informative results. It is also possible to combine a minimum effect test and an equivalence test. One might even say that such a combination is the most informative test of a prediction whenever a smallest effect size of interest can be specified. In principle, this is true. As long as we are able to collect enough data, we will always get an informative and straightforward answer when we combine a minimum effect test with an equivalence test: Either we can reject all effects that are too small to be of interest, or we can reject all effects that are large enough to be of interest. As we will see below in the section on power analysis for interval hypotheses, whenever the true effect size is close to the smallest effect size of interest, a large amount of observations will need to be collected. And if the true effect size happens to be identical to the smallest effect size of interest, neither the minimum effect test nor the equivalence test can be correctly rejected (and any significant test would be a Type 1 error). If a researcher can collect sufficient data (so that the test has high statistical power), and is relatively confident that the true effect size will be larger or smaller than the smallest effect of interest, then the combination of a minimum effect test and an equivalence test can be attractive as such a hypothesis test is likely to yield an informative answer to the research question."

    "section": "\n9.4 Power Analysis for Interval Hypothesis Tests",
    "text": "9.4 Power Analysis for Interval Hypothesis Tests\nWhen designing a study it is a sensible strategy to always plan for both the presence and the absence of an effect. Several scientific journals require a sample size justification for Registered Reports where the statistical power to reject the null hypothesis is high, but where the study is also capable of demonstrating the absence of an effect, for example by also performing a power analysis for an equivalence test. As we saw in the chapter on error control and likelihoods null results are to be expected, and if you only think about the possibility of observing a null effect when the data has been collected, it is often too late.\nThe statistical power for interval hypotheses depend on the alpha level, the sample size, the smallest effect of interest you decide to test against, and the true effect size. For an equivalence test, it is common to perform a power analysis assuming the true effect size is 0, but this might not always be realistic. The closer the expected effect size is to the smallest effect size of interest, the larger the sample size needed to reach a desired power. Don’t be tempted to assume a true effect size of 0, if you have good reason to expect a small but non-zero true effect size. The sample size that the power analysis indicates you need to collect might be smaller, but in reality you also have a higher probability of an inconclusive result. Earlier versions of TOSTER only enabled researchers to perform power analyses for equivalence tests assuming a true effect size of 0, but a new power function by Aaron Caldwell allows users to specify delta, the expected effect size.\nAssume a researchers desired to achieve 90% power for an equivalence test with an equivalence range from -0.5 to 0.5, with an alpha level of 0.05, and assuming a population effect size of 0. A power analysis for an equivalence test can be performed to examine the required sample size.\n\nTOSTER::power_t_TOST(power = 0.9, delta = 0,\n                     alpha = 0.05, type = \"two.sample\",\n                     low_eqbound = -0.5, high_eqbound = 0.5)\n\n\n     Two-sample TOST power calculation \n\n          power = 0.9\n           beta = 0.1\n          alpha = 0.05\n              n = 87.26261\n          delta = 0\n             sd = 1\n         bounds = -0.5, 0.5\n\nNOTE: n is number in *each* group\n\n\nWe see that the required sample size is 88 participants in each condition for the independent t-test. Let’s compare this power analysis to a situation where the researcher expects a true effect of d = 0.1, instead of a true effect of 0. To be able to reliably reject effects larger than 0.5, we will need a larger sample size, just as how we need a larger sample size for a null hypothesis test powered to detect d = 0.4 than a null hypothesis test powered to detect d = 0.5.\n\nTOSTER::power_t_TOST(power = 0.9, delta = 0.1,\n                     alpha = 0.05, type = \"two.sample\",\n                     low_eqbound = -0.5, high_eqbound = 0.5)\n\n\n     Two-sample TOST power calculation \n\n          power = 0.9\n           beta = 0.1\n          alpha = 0.05\n              n = 108.9187\n          delta = 0.1\n             sd = 1\n         bounds = -0.5, 0.5\n\nNOTE: n is number in *each* group\n\n\nWe see the sample size has now increased to 109 participants in each condition. As mentioned before, it is not necessary to perform a two-sided equivalence test. It is also possible to perform a one-sided equivalence test. An example of a situation where such a directional test is appropriate is a replication study. If a previous study observed an effect of d = 0.48, and you perform a replication study, you might decide to consider any effect smaller than d = 0.2 a failure to replicate - including any effect in the opposite direction, such as an effect of d = -0.3. Although most software for equivalence tests requires you to specify an upper and lower bound for an equivalence range, you can mimic a one-sided test by setting the equivalence bound in the direction you want to ignore to a low value so that the one-sided test against this value will always be statistically significant. This can also be used to perform a power analysis for a minimum effect test, where one bound is the minimum effect of interest, and the other bound is set to an extreme value on the other side of the expected effect size.\nIn the power analysis for an equivalence test example below, the lower bound is set to -5 (it should be set low enough such that lowering it even further has no noticeable effect). We see that the new power function in the TOSTER package takes the directional prediction into account, and just as with directional predictions in a nil null hypothesis test, a directional prediction in an equivalence test is more efficient, and only 70 observations are needed to achieve 90% power.\n\n# New TOSTER power functions allows power for expected non-zero effect.\nTOSTER::power_t_TOST(power = 0.9, delta = 0,\n                     alpha = 0.05, type = \"two.sample\",\n                     low_eqbound = -5, high_eqbound = 0.5)\n\n\n     Two-sample TOST power calculation \n\n          power = 0.9\n           beta = 0.1\n          alpha = 0.05\n              n = 69.19784\n          delta = 0\n             sd = 1\n         bounds = -5.0, 0.5\n\nNOTE: n is number in *each* group\n\n\nStatistical software offers options for power analyses for some statistical tests, but not for all tests. Just as with power analysis for a nil null hypothesis test, it can be necessary to use a simulation-based approach to power analysis."

    "text": "9.5 The Bayesian ROPE procedure\nIn Bayesian estimation, one way to argue for the absence of a meaningful effect is the region of practical equivalence (ROPE) procedure (Kruschke (2013)), which is “somewhat analogous to frequentist equivalence testing” (Kruschke & Liddell (2017)). In the ROPE procedure, an equivalence range is specified, just as in equivalence testing, but the Bayesian highest density interval based on a posterior distribution (as explained in the chapter on Bayesian statistics) is used instead of the confidence interval.\nIf the prior used by Kruschke was perfectly uniform, and the ROPE procedure and an equivalence test used the same confidence interval (e.g., 90%), the two tests would yield identical results. There would only be philosophical differences in how the numbers are interpreted. The BEST package in R that can be used to perform the ROPE procedure by default uses a ‘broad’ prior, and therefore results of the ROPE procedure and an equivalence test are not exactly the same, but they are very close. One might even argue the two tests are ‘practically equivalent’. In the R code below, random normally distributed data for two conditions is generated (with means of 0 and a standard deviation of 1) and the ROPE procedure and a TOST equivalence test are performed.\n\n\nWaiting for parallel processing to complete...done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 90% HDI ranges from -0.06 to 0.39, with an estimated mean based on the prior and the data of 0.164. The HDI falls completely between the upper and the lower bound of the equivalence range, and therefore values more extreme than -0.5 or 0.5 are deemed implausible. The 95% CI ranges from -0.07 to 0.36 with an observed mean difference of 0.15. We see that the numbers are not identical, because in Bayesian estimation the observed values are combined with a prior, and the mean estimate is not purely based on the data. But the results are very similar, and will in most cases lead to similar inferences. The BEST R package also enables researchers to perform simulation based power analyses, which take a long time but, when using a broad prior, yield a result that is basically identical to the sample size from a power analysis for an equivalence test. The biggest benefit of ROPE over TOST is that it allows you to incorporate prior information. If you have reliable prior information, ROPE can use this information, which is especially useful if you don’t have a lot of data. If you use informed priors, check the robustness of the posterior against reasonable changes in the prior in sensitivity analyses."

    "text": "9.6 Which interval width should be used?\nBecause the TOST procedure is based on two one-sided tests, a 90% confidence interval is used when the one-sided tests are performed at an alpha level of 5%. Because both the test against the upper bound and the test against the lower bound needs to be statistically significant to declare equivalence (which as explained in the chapter on error control is an intersection-union approach to multiple testing) it is not necessary to correct for the fact that two tests are performed. If the alpha level is adjusted for multiple comparisons, or if the alpha level is justified instead of relying on the default 5% level (or both), the corresponding confidence interval should be used, where CI = 100 - (2 * \\(\\alpha\\)). Thus, the width of the confidence interval is directly related to the choice for the alpha level, as we are making decisions to reject the smallest effect size of interest, or not, based on whether the confidence interval excluded the effect that is tested against.\nWhen using a Highest Density Interval from a Bayesian perspective, such as the ROPE procedure, the choice for a width of a confidence interval does not follow logically from a desired error rate, or any other principle. Kruschke (2014) writes: “How should we define ‘reasonably credible’? One way is by saying that any points within the 95% HDI are reasonably credible.” McElreath (2016) has recommended the use of 67%, 89%, and 97%, because “No reason. They are prime numbers, which makes them easy to remember.”. Both these suggestions lack a solid justification. As Gosset (or Student), observed (1904):\n\nResults are only valuable when the amount by which they probably differ from the truth is so small as to be insignificant for the purposes of the experiment. What the odds selected should be depends-\n1. On the degree of accuracy which the nature of the experiment allows, and\n2. On the importance of the issues at stake.\n\nThere are only two principled solutions. First, if a highest density interval width is used to make claims, these claims will be made with certain error rates, and researchers should quantify the risk of erroneous claims by computing frequentist error rates. This would make the ROPE procedure a Bayesian/Frequentist compromise procedure, where the computation of a posterior distribution allows for Bayesian interpretations of which parameters values are believed to be most probable, while decisions based on whether or not the HDI falls within an equivalence range have a formally controlled error rate. Note that when using an informative prior, an HDI does not match a CI, and the error rate when using an HDI can only be derived through simulations. The second solution is to not make any claims, present the full posterior distribution, and let readers draw their own conclusions."

    "text": "9.7 Setting the Smallest Effect Size of Interest\nTo be able to falsify our predictions using an equivalence test is to specify which observed values would be too small to be predicted by our theory. We can never say that an effect is exactly zero, but we can examine whether observed effects are too small to be theoretically or practically interesting. This requires that we specify the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI). The same concept goes by many names, such as a minimal important difference, or clinically significant difference (King, 2011). Take a moment to think about what the smallest effect size is that you would still consider theoretically or practically meaningful for the next study you are designing. It might be difficult to determine what the smallest effect size is that you would consider interesting, and the question what the smallest effect size of interest is might be something you have never really thought about to begin with. However, determining your smallest effect size of interest has important practical benefits. First, if researchers in a field are able to specify which effects would be too small to matter, it becomes very straightforward to power a study for the effects that are meaningful. The second benefit of specifying the smallest effect size of interest is that it makes your study falsifiable. Having your predictions falsified by someone else might not feel that great for you personally, but it is quite useful for science as a whole (Popper, 2002). After all, if there is no way a prediction can be wrong, why would anyone be impressed if the prediction is right?\nTo start thinking about which effect sizes matter, ask yourself whether any effect in the predicted direction is actually support for the alternative hypothesis. For example, would an effect size of a Cohen’s d of 10 be support for your hypothesis? In psychology, it should be rare that a theory prediucts such a huge effect, and if you observed a d = 10, you would probably check for either a computation error, or a confound in the study. On the other end of the scale, would an effect of d = 0.001 be in line with the theoretically proposed mechanism? Such an effect is incredibly small, and is well below what an individual would notice, as it would fall below the just noticeable difference given perceptual and cognitive limitations. Therefore, a d = 0.001 would in most cases lead researchers to conclude “Well, this is really too small to be something that my theory has predicted, and such a small effect is practically equivalent to the absence of an effect.” However, when we make a directional prediction, we say that these types of effects are all part of our alternative hypothesis. Even though many researchers would agree such tiny effects are too small to matter, they still officially support for our alternative hypothesis if we have a directional prediction with a nil null hypothesis. Furthermore, researchers rarely have the resources to statistically reject the presence of effects this small, so the claim that such effects would still support a theoretical prediction makes the theory practically unfalsifiable: A researcher could simply respond to any replication study showing a non-significant small effect (e.g., d = 0.05) by saying: “That does not falsify my prediction. I suppose the effect is just a bit smaller than d = 0.05”, without ever having to admit the prediction is falsified. This is problematic, because if we do not have a process of replication and falsification, a scientific discipline risks a slide towards the unfalsifiable (Ferguson & Heene, 2012). So whenever possible, when you design an experiment or you have a theory and a theoretical prediction, carefully think about, and clearly state, what the smallest effect size of interest is."

(2015), who examined whether women displayed increased redness in the face during the fertile phase of their ovulatory cycle. The hypothesis was that a slightly redder skin signals greater attractiveness and physical health, and that sending this signal to men yields an evolutionary advantage. This hypothesis presupposes that men can detect the increase in redness with the naked eye. Burriss et al. collected data from 22 women and showed that the redness of their facial skin indeed increased during their fertile period. However, this increase was not large enough for men to detect with the naked eye, so the hypothesis was falsified. Because the just-noticeable difference in redness of the skin can be measured, it was possible to establish a theoretically motivated SESOI. A theoretically motivated smallest effect size of interest can be derived from just-noticeable differences, which provide a lower bound on effect sizes that can influence individuals, or based on computational models, which can provide a lower bound on parameters in the model that will still be able to explain observed findings in the empirical literature."

    "text": "9.9 Anchor based methods to set a SESOI\nBuilding on the idea of a just-noticeable difference, psychologists are often interested in effects that are large enough to be noticed by single individuals. One procedure to estimate what constitutes a meaningful change on an individual level is the anchor-based method (Jaeschke et al., 1989; King, 2011; Norman et al., 2004). Measurements are collected at two time points (e.g., a quality of life measure before and after treatment). At the second time point, an independent measure (the anchor) is used to determine if individuals show no change compared to time point 1, or if they have improved, or worsened. Often, the patient is directly asked to answer the anchor question, and indicate if they subjectively feel the same, better, or worse at time point 2 compared to time point 1. Button et al. (2015) used an anchor-based method to estimate that a minimal clinically important difference on the Beck Depression Inventory corresponded to a 17.5% reduction in scores from baseline.\nAnvari and Lakens (2021) applied the anchor-based method to examine a smallest effect of interest as measured by the widely used Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). Participants completed the 20 item PANAS at two time points several days apart (using a Likert scale going from 1 = “very slightly or not at all”, to 5 = “extremely”). At the second time point they were also asked to indicate if their affect had changed a little, a lot, or not at all. When people indicated their affect had changed “a little”, the average change in Likert units was 0.26 scale points for positive affect and 0.28 scale points for negative affect. Thus, an intervention to improve people’s affective state that should lead to what individuals subjectively consider at least a little improvement might set the SESOI at 0.3 units on the PANAS."

Research shows that cognitive training may improve mental abilities in older adults which might benefit older drivers (Ball et al., 2002). Based on these findings, Viamonte, Ball, and Kilgore (2006) performed a cost-benefit analysis and concluded that based on the cost of the intervention ($247.50), the probability of an accident for drivers older than 75 (p = 0.0710), and the cost of an accident ($22,000), performing the intervention on all drivers aged 75 or older was more efficient than not intervening or only intervening after a screening test. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses revealed that intervening for all drivers would remain beneficial as long as the reduction in collision risk is 25%. Therefore, a 25% reduction in the probability of elderly above 75 getting into a car accident could be set as the smallest effect size of interest.\nFor another example, economists have examined the value of a statistical life, based on willingness to pay to reduce the risk of death, at $1.5 - $2.5 million (in the year 2000, in western countries, see Mrozek & Taylor (2002)). Building on this work, Abelson (2003) calculated the willingness to pay to prevent acute health issues such as eye irritation at about $40-$50 per day. A researcher may be examining a psychological intervention that reduces the amount of times people touch their face close to their eyes, thereby reducing eye irritations caused by bacteria. If the intervention costs $20 per year to administer, it therefore should reduce the average number of days with eye irritation in the population by at least 0.5 days for the intervention to be worth the cost. A cost-benefit analysis can also be based on the resources required to empirically study a very small effect when weighed against the value this knowledge would have for the scientific community."

    "text": "9.11 Specifying the SESOI using the small telescopes approach\nIdeally, researchers who publish empirical claims would always specify which observations would falsify their claim. Regrettably, this is not yet common practice. This is particularly problematic when a researcher performs a close replication of earlier work. Because it is never possible to prove an effect is exactly zero, and the original authors seldom specify which range of effect sizes would falsify their hypotheses, it has proven to be very difficult to interpret the outcome of a replication study (Anderson & Maxwell, 2016). When does the new data contradict the original finding?\nConsider a study in which you want to test the idea of the wisdom of crowds. You ask 20 people to estimate the number of coins in a jar, expecting the average to be very close to the true value. The research question is whether the people can on average correctly guess the number of coins, which is 500. The observed mean guess by 20 people is 550, with a standard deviation of 100. The observed difference from the true value is statistically significant, t(19)=2.37, p = 0.0375, with a Cohen’s d of 0.5. Can it really be that the group average is so far off? Is there no Wisdom of Crowds? Was there something special about the coins you used that make it especially difficult to guess their number? Or was it just a fluke? You set out to perform a close replication of this study.\nYou want your study to be informative, regardless of whether there is an effect or not. This means you need to design a replication study that will allow you to draw an informative conclusion, regardless of whether the alternative hypothesis is true (the crowd will not estimate the true number of coins accurately) or whether the null hypothesis is true (the crowd will guess 500 coins, and the original study was a fluke). But since the original researcher did not specify a smallest effect size of interest, when would a replication study allow you to conclude the original study is contradicted by the new data? Observing a mean of exactly 500 would perhaps be considered by some to be quite convincing, but due to random variation you will (almost) never find a mean score of exactly 500. A non-significant result can’t be interpreted as the absence of an effect, because your study might have too small a sample size to detect meaningful effects, and the result might be a Type 2 error. So how can we move forward and define an effect size that is meaningful? How can you design a study that has the ability to falsify a previous finding?\nUri Simonsohn (2015) defines a small effect as “one that would give 33% power to the original study”. In other words, the effect size that would give the original study odds of 2:1 against observing a statistically significant result if there was an effect. The idea is that if the original study had 33% power, the probability of observing a significant effect, if there was a true effect, is too low to reliably distinguish signal from noise (or situations where there is a true effect from situations where there is no true effect). Simonsohn (2015, p. 561) calls this the small telescopes approach, and writes: “Imagine an astronomer claiming to have found a new planet with a telescope. Another astronomer tries to replicate the discovery using a larger telescope and finds nothing. Although this does not prove that the planet does not exist, it does nevertheless contradict the original findings, because planets that are observable with the smaller telescope should also be observable with the larger one.”\nAlthough this approach to setting a smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) is arbitrary (why not 30% power, or 35%?) it suffices for practical purposes (and you are free to choose a power level you think is too low). The nice thing about this definition of a SESOI is that if you know the sample size of the original study, you can always calculate the effect size that study had 33% power to detect. You can thus always use this approach to set a smallest effect size of interest. If you fail to find support for an effect size the original study has 33% power to detect, it does not mean there is no true effect, and not even that the effect is too small to be of any theoretical or practical interest. But using the small telescopes approach is a good first step, since it will get the conversation started about which effects are meaningful and allows researchers who want to replicate a study to specify when they would consider the original claim falsified.\nWith the small telescopes approach, the SESOI is based only on the sample size in the original study. A smallest effect size of interest is set only for effects in the same direction. All effects smaller than this effect (including large effects in the opposite direction) are interpreted as a failure to replicate the original results. We see that the small telescopes approach is a one-sided equivalence test, where only the upper bound is specified, and the smallest effect size of interest is determined based on the sample size of the original study. The test examines if we can reject effects as large or larger than the effect the original study has 33% power to detect. It is a simple one-sided test, not against 0, but against a SESOI.\nFor example, consider our study above in which 20 guessers tried to estimate the number of coins. The results were analyzed with a two-sided one-sample t-test, using an alpha level of 0.05. To determine the effect size that this study had 33% power for, we can perform a sensitivity analysis. In a sensitivity analysis we compute the required effect size given the alpha, sample size, and desired statistical power. Note that Simonsohn uses a two-sided test in his power analyses, which we will follow here – if the original study reported a pre-registered directional prediction, the power analysis should be based on a one-sided test. In this case, the alpha level is 0.05, the total sample size is 20, and the desired power is 33%. We compute the effect size that gives us 33% power and see that it is a Cohen’s d of 0.358. This means we can set our smallest effect size of interest for the replication study to d = 0.358. If we can reject effects as large or larger than d = 0.358, we can conclude that the effect is smaller than anything the original study had 33% power for. The screenshot below illustrates the correct settings in G*Power, and the code in R is:\n\nlibrary(\"pwr\")\n\npwr::pwr.t.test(\n  n = 20, \n  sig.level = 0.05, \n  power = 0.33, \n  type = \"one.sample\",\n  alternative = \"two.sided\"\n)\n\n\n     One-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 20\n              d = 0.3577466\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.33\n    alternative = two.sided\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6: Screenshot illustrating a sensitivity power analysis in G*Power to compute the effect size an original study had 33% power to detect.\n\n\n\n\nDetermining the SESOI based on the effect size the original study had 33% power to detect has an additional convenient property. Imagine the true effect size is actually 0, and you perform a statistical test to see if the data is statistically smaller than the SESOI based on the small telescopes approach (which is called an inferiority test). If you increase the sample size by 2.5 times, you will have approximately 80% power for this one-sided equivalence test, assuming the true effect size is exactly 0 (e.g., d = 0). People who do a replication study can follow the small telescope recommendations, and very easily determine both the smallest effect size of interest, and the sample size needed to design an informative replication study, assuming the true effect size is 0 (but see the section above for a-priori power analyses where you want to test for equivalence, but do not expect a true effect size of 0).\nThe figure below, from Simonsohn (2015) illustrates the small telescopes approach using a real-life example. The original study by Zhong and Liljenquist (2006) had a tiny sample size of 30 participants in each condition and observed an effect size of d = 0.53, which was barely statistically different from zero. Given a sample size of 30 per condition, the study had 33% power to detect effects larger than d = 0.401. This “small effect” is indicated by the green dashed line. In R, the smallest effect size of interest is calculated using:\n\npwr::pwr.t.test(\n  n = 30, \n  sig.level = 0.05, \n  power = 1/3, \n  type = \"two.sample\",\n  alternative = \"two.sided\"\n)\n\n\n     Two-sample t test power calculation \n\n              n = 30\n              d = 0.401303\n      sig.level = 0.05\n          power = 0.3333333\n    alternative = two.sided\n\nNOTE: n is number in *each* group\n\n\nNote that 33% power is a rounded value, and the calculation uses 1/3 (or 0.3333333…).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.7: Example used in Simonsohn (2015) of an original study and two replication studies.\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the first replication by Gámez and colleagues also had a relatively small sample size (N = 47, compared to N = 60 in the original study), and was not designed to yield informative results when interpreted with a small telescopes approach. The confidence interval is very wide and includes the null effect (d = 0) and the smallest effect size of interest (d = 0.401). Thus, this study is inconclusive. We can’t reject the null, but we can also not reject effect sizes of 0.401 or larger that are still considered to be in line with the original result. The second replication has a much larger sample size, and tells us that we can’t reject the null, but we can reject the smallest effect size of interest, suggesting that the effect is smaller than what is considered an interesting effect based on the small telescopes approach.\nAlthough the small telescope recommendations are easy to use, one should take care not to turn any statistical procedure into a heuristic. In our example above with the 20 referees, a Cohen’s d of 0.358 would be used as a smallest effect size of interest, and a sample size of 50 would be collected (2.5 times the original 20), but if someone would make the effort to perform a replication study, it would be relatively easy to collect a larger sample size. Alternatively, had the original study been extremely large, it would have had high power for effects that might not be practically significant, and we would not want to collect 2.5 times as many observations in a replication study. Indeed, as Simonsohn writes: “whether we need 2.5 times the original sample size or not depends on the question we wish to answer. If we are interested in testing whether the effect size is smaller than d33%, then, yes, we need about 2.5 times the original sample size no matter how big that original sample was. When samples are very large, however, that may not be the question of interest.” Always think about the question you want to ask, and design the study so that it provides an informative answer for a question of interest. Do not automatically follow a 2.5 times n heuristic, and always reflect on whether the use of a suggested procedure is appropriate in your situation."

    "text": "9.12 Setting the Smallest Effect Size of Interest to the Minimal Statistically Detectable Effect\nGiven a sample size and alpha level, every test has a minimal statistically detectable effect. For example, given a test with 86 participants in each group, and an alpha level of 5%, only t-tests which yield a t ≥ 1.974 will be statistically significant. In other words, t = 1.974 is the critical t-value. Given a sample size and alpha level, the critical t-value can be transformed into a critical d-value. As visualized in Figure 9.8, with n = 50 in each group and an alpha level of 5% the critical d-value is 0.4. This means that only effects larger than 0.4 will yield a p &lt; α. The critical d-value is influenced by the sample size per group, and the alpha level, but does not depend on the the true effect size.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.8: Null and alternative distribution with Type 1 and Type 2 error indicating the smallest effect size that will be statistically significant with n = 50 per condition.\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to observe a statistically significant test result if the true effect size is smaller than the critical effect size. Due to random variation, it is possible to observe a larger value in a sample than is the true value in the population. This is the reason the statistical power of a test is never 0 in a null hypothesis significance test. As illustrated in Figure 9.9, even if the true effect size is smaller than the critical value (i.e., if the true effect size is 0.2) we see from the distribution that we can expect some observed effect sizes to be larger than 0.4 when the true population effect size is d = 0.2 – if we compute the statistical power for this test, it turns out we can expect 16.77% of the observed effect sizes will be larger than 0.4, in the long run. That is not a lot, but it is something. This is also the reason why publication bias combined with underpowered research is problematic: It leads to a large overestimation of the true effect size when only observed effect sizes from statistically significant findings in underpowered studies end up in the scientific literature.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.9: Null and alternative distribution with Type 1 and Type 2 error indicating the smallest effect size that will be statistically significant with n = 50 per condition.\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the minimal statistically detectable effect to set the SESOI for replication studies. If you attempt to replicate a study, one justifiable option when choosing the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) is to use the smallest observed effect size that could have been statistically significant in the study you are replicating. In other words, you decide that effects that could not have yielded a p-value less than α in an original study will not be considered meaningful in the replication study. The assumption here is that the original authors were interested in observing a significant effect, and thus were not interested in observed effect sizes that could not have yielded a significant result. It might be likely that the original authors did not consider which effect sizes their study had good statistical power to detect, or that they were interested in smaller effects but gambled on observing an especially large effect in the sample purely as a result of random variation. Even then, when building on earlier research that does not specify a SESOI, a justifiable starting point might be to set the SESOI to the smallest effect size that, when observed in the original study, could have been statistically significant. Not all researchers might agree with this (e.g., the original authors might say they actually cared just as much about an effect of d =0.001). However, as we try to change the field from the current situation where no one specifies what would falsify their hypothesis, or what their smallest effect size of interest is, this approach is one way to get started. In practice, as explained in the section on post-hoc power, due to the relation between p = 0.05 and 50% power for the observed effect size, this justification for a SESOI will mean that the SESOI is set to the effect size the original study had 50% power to detect for an independent ttest. This approach is in some ways similar to the small telescopes approach by Simonsohn (2015), except that it will lead to a somewhat larger SESOI.\nSetting a smallest effect size of interest for a replication study is a bit like a tennis match. Original authors serve and hit the ball across the net, saying ‘look, something is going on’. The approach to set the SESOI to the effect size that could have been significant in the original study is a return volley which allows you to say ‘there does not seem to be anything large enough that could have been significant in your own original study’ after performing a well-designed replication study with high statistical power to reject the SESOI. This is never the end of the match – the original authors can attempt to return the ball with a more specific statement about effects their theory predicts, and demonstrate such a smaller effect size is present. But the ball is back in their court, and if they want to continue to claim there is an effect, they will have to support their claim by new data.\nBeyond replication studies, the amount of data that is collected limits the inferences one can make. It is also possible to compute a minimal statistically detectable effect based on the sample sizes that are typically used in a research field. For example, imagine a line of research in which a hypothesis has almost always been tested by performing a one-sample t-test, and where the sample sizes that are collected are always smaller than 100 observations. A one-sample t-test on 100 observations, using an alpha of .05 (two sided), has 80% power to detect an effect of d = 0.28 (as can be calculated in a sensitivity power analysis). In a new study, concluding that one can reliably reject the presence of effects more extreme than d = 0.28 suggests that sample sizes of 100 might not be enough to detect effects in such research lines. Rejecting the presence of effects more extreme than d = 0.28 does not test a theoretical prediction, but it contributes to the literature by answering a resource question. It suggests that future studies in this research line will need to change the design of their studies by substantially increasing the sample size. Setting the smallest effect size of interest based on this approach does not answer any theoretical question (after all, the SESOI is not based on any theoretical prediction). But informing peers that given the sample size commonly collected in a field in a field, the effect is not large enough so that it can be reliably studied is a useful contribution to the literature. It does not mean that the effect is not interesting per se, and a field might decide that it is time to examine the research question collaboratively, by coordinating research lines, and collecting enough data to reliably study whether a smaller effect is present."

    "text": "9.13 Test Yourself\n\n9.13.1 Questions about equivalence tests\nQ1: When the 90% CI around a mean difference falls just within the equivalence range from -0.4 to 0.4, we can reject the smallest effect size of interest. Based on your knowledge about confidence intervals, when the equivalence range is changed to -0.3 – 0.3, what is needed for the equivalence test to be significant (assuming the effect size estimate and standard deviation remains the same)?\n\n\nA larger effect size.A lower alpha level.A larger sample size.Lower statistical power.\n\n\nQ2: Why is it incorrect to conclude that there is no effect, when an equivalence test is statistically significant?\n\n\nAn equivalence test is a statement about the data, not about the presence or absence of an effect. The result of an equivalence test could be a Type 1 error, and therefore, one should conclude that there is no effect, or a Type 1 error has been observed. An equivalence test rejects values as large or larger than the smallest effect size of interest, so the possibility that there is a small non-zero effect cannot be rejected.We conclude there is no effect when the equivalence test is non-significant, not when the equivalence test is significant.\n\n\nQ3: Researchers are interested in showing that students who use an online textbook perform just as well as students who use a paper textbook. If so, they can recommend teachers to allow students to choose their preferred medium, but if there is a benefit, they would recommend the medium that leads to better student performance. They randomly assign students to use an online textbook or a paper textbook, and compare their grades on the exam for the course (from the worst possible grade, 1, to the best possible grade, 10). They find that the both groups of students perform similarly, with for the paper textbook condition m = 7.35, sd = 1.15, n = 50, and the online textbook m = 7.13, sd = 1.21, n = 50). Let’s assume we consider any effect as large or larger than half a grade point (0.5) worthwhile, but any difference smaller than 0.5 too small to matter, and the alpha level is set at 0.05. What would the authors conclude? Copy the code below into R, replacing all zeroes with the correct numbers.

We can not reject an effect size of zero, and we can reject the presence of effects as large or larger than the smallest effect size of interest. We can reject an effect size of zero, and we can not reject the presence of effects as large or larger than the smallest effect size of interest. We can not reject an effect size of zero, and we can not reject the presence of effects as large or larger than the smallest effect size of interest.\n\n\nQ4: If we increase the sample size in question Q3 to 150 participants in each condition, and assuming the observed means and standard deviations would be exactly the same, which conclusion would we draw?\n\n\nWe can reject an effect size of zero, and we can reject the presence of effects as large or larger than the smallest effect size of interest. We can not reject an effect size of zero, and we can reject the presence of effects as large or larger than the smallest effect size of interest.

We can not reject an effect size of zero, and we can not reject the presence of effects as large or larger than the smallest effect size of interest.\n\n\nQ5: If we increase the sample size in question Q3 to 500 participants in each condition, and assuming the observed means and standard deviations would be exactly the same, which conclusion would we draw?\n\n\nWe can reject an effect size of zero, and we can reject the presence of effects as large or larger than the smallest effect size of interest. We can not reject an effect size of zero, and we can reject the presence of effects as large or larger than the smallest effect size of interest. We can reject an effect size of zero, and we can not reject the presence of effects as large or larger than the smallest effect size of interest. We can not reject an effect size of zero, and we can not reject the presence of effects as large or larger than the smallest effect size of interest.\n\n\nSometimes the result of a test is inconclusive, as both the null hypothesis test, and the equivalence test, of not statistically significant. The only solution in such a case is to collect additional data. Sometimes both the null hypothesis test and the equivalence test are statistically significant, in which case the effect is statistically different from zero, but practically insignificant (based on the justification for the SESOI).\nQ6: We might wonder what the statistical power was for the test in Q3, assuming there was no true difference between the two groups (so a true effect size of 0). Using the new and improved power_t_TOST function in the TOSTER R package, we can compute the power using a sensitivity power analysis (i.e., entering the sample size per group of 50, the assumed true effect size of 0, the equivalence bounds, and the alpha level. Note that because the equivalence bounds were specified on a raw scale in Q3, we will also need to specify an estimate for the true standard deviation in the population. Let’s assume this true standard deviation is 1.2. Round the answer to two digits after the decimal. Type ?power_t_TOST for help with the function. What was the power in Q3?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOSTER::power_t_TOST(\n  n = 00,\n  delta = 0.0,\n  sd = 0.0,\n  low_eqbound = -0.0,\n  high_eqbound = 0.0,\n  alpha = 0.05,\n  type = \"two.sample\"\n)\n\n\n\n0.000.050.330.40\n\n\nQ7: Assume we would only have had 15 participants in each group in Q3, instead of 50. What would be the statistical power of the test with this smaller sample size (keeping all other settings as in Q6)? Round the answer to 2 digits.\n\n\n0.000.050.330.40\n\n\nQ8: You might remember from discussions on statistical power for a null hypothesis significance test that the statistical power is never smaller than 5% (if the true effect size is 0, power is formally undefined, but we will observe at least 5% Type 1 errors, and the power increases when introducing a true effect). In a two-sided equivalence tests, power can be lower than the alpha level. Why?\n\n\nBecause in an equivalence test the Type 1 error rate is not bounded at 5%.Because in an equivalence test the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are reversed, and therefore the Type 2 error rate does not have a lower bound (just as the Type 1 error rate in NHST has no lower bound).Because the confidence interval needs to fall between the lower and upper bound of the equivalence interval, and with small sample sizes, this probability can be close to zero (because the confidence interval is very wide).Because the equivalence test is based on a confidence interval, and not on a p-value, and therefore power is not limited by the alpha level. \n\n\nQ9: A well designed study has high power to detect an effect of interest, but also to reject the smallest effect size of interest. Perform an a-priori power analysis for the situation described in Q3. Which sample size in each group needs to be collected to achieved a desired statistical power of 90% (or 0.9), assuming the true effect size is 0, and we still assume the true standard deviation is 1.2? Use the code below, and round up the sample size (as we cannot collect a partial observation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOSTER::power_t_TOST(\n  power = 0.00,\n  delta = 0.0,\n  sd = 0.0,\n  low_eqbound = -0.0,\n  high_eqbound = 0.0,\n  alpha = 0.05,\n  type = \"two.sample\"\n)\n\n\n\n100126200252\n\n\nQ10: Assume that when performing the power analysis for Q9 we did not expect the true effect size to be 0, but we actually expected a mean difference of 0.1 grade point. Which sample size in each group would we need to collect for the equivalence test, now that we expect a true effect size of 0.1? Change the variable delta in power_t_TOST to answer this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1171573143118\n\n\nQ11: Change the equivalence range to -0.1 and 0.1 for Q9 (and set the expected effect size of delta to 0). To be able to reject effects outside such a very narrow equivalence range, you’ll need a large sample size. With an alpha of 0.05, and a desired power of 0.9 (or 90%), how many participants would you need in each group?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1171573143118\n\n\nYou can see it takes a very large sample size to have high power to reliably reject very small effects. This should not be surprising. After all, it also requires a very large sample size to detect small effects! This is why we typically leave it to a future meta-analysis to detect, or reject, the presence of small effects.\nQ12: You can do equivalence tests for all tests. The TOSTER package has functions for t-tests, correlations, differences between proportions, and meta-analyses. If the test you want to perform is not included in any software, remember that you can just use a 90% confidence interval, and test whether you can reject the smallest effect size of interest. Let’s perform an equivalence test for a meta-analysis. Hyde, Lindberg, Linn, Ellis, and Williams (2008) report that effect sizes for gender differences in mathematics tests across the 7 million students in the US represent trivial differences, where a trivial difference is specified as an effect size smaller then d =0.1. The table with Cohen’s d and se is reproduced below:\n\n\nGrades\nd + se\n\n\n\nGrade 2\n0.06 +/- 0.003\n\n\nGrade 3\n0.04 +/- 0.002\n\n\nGrade 4\n-0.01 +/- 0.002\n\n\nGrade 5\n-0.01 +/- 0.002\n\n\nGrade 6\n-0.01 +/- 0.002\n\n\nGrade 7\n-0.02 +/- 0.002\n\n\nGrade 8\n-0.02 +/- 0.002\n\n\nGrade 9\n-0.01 +/- 0.003\n\n\nGrade 10\n0.04 +/- 0.003\n\n\nGrade 11\n0.06 +/- 0.003\n\n\n\nFor grade 2, when we perform an equivalence test with boundaries of d =-0.1 and d =0.1, using an alpha of 0.01, which conclusion can we draw?

We can not reject an effect size of zero, and we can reject the presence of effects as large or larger than the smallest effect size of interest. We can reject an effect size of zero, and we can not reject the presence of effects as large or larger than the smallest effect size of interest. We can not reject an effect size of zero, and we can not reject the presence of effects as large or larger than the smallest effect size of interest.\n\n\n\n9.13.2 Questions about the small telescopes approach\nQ13: What is the smallest effect size of interest based on the small telescopes approach, when the original study collected 20 participants in each condition of an independent t-test, with an alpha level of 0.05. Note that for this answer, it happens to depend on whether you enter the power as 0.33 or 1/3 (or 0.333). You can use the code below, which relies on the pwr package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npwr::pwr.t.test(\n  n = 0, \n  sig.level = 0.00, \n  power = 0, \n  type = \"two.sample\",\n  alternative = \"two.sided\"\n)\n\n\n\nd =0.25 (setting power to 0.33) or 0.26 (setting power to 1/3)d =0.33 (setting power to 0.33) or 0.34 (setting power to 1/3)d =0.49 (setting power to 0.33) or 0.50 (setting power to 1/3)d =0.71 (setting power to 0.33) or 0.72 (setting power to 1/3)\n\n\nQ14: Let’s assume you are trying to replicate a previous result based on a correlation in a two-sided test. The study had 150 participants. Calculate the SESOI using a small telescopes justification for a replication of this study that will use an alpha level of 0.05. Note that for this answer, it happens to depend on whether you enter the power as 0.33 or 1/3 (or 0.333). You can use the code below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npwr::pwr.r.test(\n  n = 0, \n  sig.level = 0, \n  power = 0, \n  alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\n\n\nr = 0.124 (setting power to 0.33) or 0.125 (setting power to 1/3)r = 0.224 (setting power to 0.33) or 0.225 (setting power to 1/3)r = 0.226 (setting power to 0.33) or 0.227 (setting power to 1/3)r = 0.402 (setting power to 0.33) or 0.403 (setting power to 1/3)\n\n\nQ15: In the age of big data researchers often have access to large databases, and can run correlations on samples of thousands of observations. Let’s assume the original study in the previous question did not have 150 observations, but 15000 observations. We still use an alpha level of 0.05. Note that for this answer, it happens to depend on whether you enter the power as 0.33 or 1/3 (or 0.333). What is the SESOI based on the small telescopes approach?\n\n\nr = 0.0124 (setting power to 0.33) or 0.0125 (setting power to 1/3)r = 0.0224 (setting power to 0.33) or 0.0225 (setting power to 1/3)r = 0.0226 (setting power to 0.33) or 0.0227 (setting power to 1/3)r = 0.0402 (setting power to 0.33) or 0.0403 (setting power to 1/3)\n\n\nIs this effect likely to be practically or theoretically significant? Probably not. This would be a situation where the small telescopes approach is not a very useful procedure to determine a smallest effect size of interest.\nQ16: Using the small telescopes approach, you set the SESOI in a replication study to d = 0.35, and set the alpha level to 0.05. After collecting the data in a well-powered replication study that was as close to the original study as practically possible, you find no significant effect, and you can reject effects as large or larger than d = 0.35. What is the correct interpretation of this result?\n\n\nThere is no effect.We can statistically reject (using an alpha of 0.05) effects anyone would find theoretically meaningful.We can statistically reject (using an alpha of 0.05) effects anyone would find practically relevant.We can statistically reject (using an alpha of 0.05) effects the original study had 33% power to detect.\n\n\n\n9.13.3 Questions about specifying the SESOI as the Minimal Statistically Detectable Effect\nQ17: Open the online Shiny app that can be used to compute the minimal statistically detectable effect for two independent groups: https://shiny.ieis.tue.nl/d_p_power/. Three sliders influence what the figure looks like: The sample size per condition, the true effect size, and the alpha level. Which statement is true?\n\n\nThe critical d-value is influenced by the sample size per group, the true effect size, but not by the alpha level.The critical d-value is influenced by the sample size per group, the alpha level, but not by the true effect size.The critical d-value is influenced by the alpha level, the true effect size, but not by the sample size per group.The critical d-value is influenced by the sample size per group, the alpha level, and by the true effect size.\n\n\nQ18: Imagine researchers performed a study with 18 participants in each condition, and performed a t-test using an alpha level of 0.01. Using the Shiny app, what is the smallest effect size that could have been statistically significant in this study?\n\n\nd = 0.47d = 0.56d = 0.91d = 1\n\n\nQ19: You expect the true effect size in your next study to be d = 0.5, and you plan to use an alpha level of 0.05. You collect 30 participants in each group for an independent t-test. Which statement is true?\n\n\nYou have low power for all possible effect sizes.Observed effect sizes of d = 0.5 will never be statistically significant.Observed effect sizes of d = 0.5 will never be statistically significant.Observed effect sizes of d = 0.5 will be statistically significant.\n\n\nThe example we have used so far was based on performing an independent t-test, but the idea can be generalized. A shiny app for an F-test is available here: https://shiny.ieis.tue.nl/f_p_power/. The effect size associated to the power of an F-test is partial eta squared (\\(\\eta_{p}^{2})\\), which for a One-Way ANOVA (visualized in the Shiny app) equals eta-squared.\nThe distribution for eta-squared looks slightly different from the distribution of Cohen’s d, primarily because an F-test is a one-directional test (and because of this, eta-squared values are all positive, while Cohen’s d can be positive or negative). The light grey line plots the expected distribution of eta-squared when the null is true, with the red area under the curve indicating Type 1 errors, and the black line plots the expected distribution of eta-squared when the true effect size is η = 0.059. The blue area indicates the expected effect sizes smaller that the critical η of 0.04, which will not be statistically significant, and thus will be Type 2 errors.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.10: Illustration of the critical F-value for two groups, 50 observations per group, and an alpha level of 0.05.\n\n\n\n\nQ20: Set the number of participants (per condition) to 14, and the number of groups to 3. Using the Shiny app at https://shiny.ieis.tue.nl/f_p_power/ which effect sizes (expressed in partial eta-squared, as indicated on the vertical axis) can be statistically significant with n = 14 per group, and 3 groups?\n\n\nOnly effects larger than 0.11Only effects larger than 0.13Only effects larger than 0.14Only effects larger than 0.16\n\n\nEvery sample size and alpha level implies a minimal statistically detectable effect that can be statistically significant in your study. Looking at which observed effects you can detect is a useful way to make sure you could actually detect the smallest effect size you are interested in.\nQ21: Using the minimal statistically detectable effect, you set the SESOI in a replication study to d = 0.35, and set the alpha level to 0.05. After collecting the data in a well-powered replication study that was as close to the original study as practically possible, you find no significant effect, and you can reject effects as large or larger than d = 0.35. What is the correct interpretation of this result?\n\n\nThere is no effect.We can statistically reject (using an alpha of 0.05) effects anyone would find theoretically meaningful.We can statistically reject (using an alpha of 0.05) effects anyone would find practically relevant.We can statistically reject (using an alpha of 0.05) effects that could have been statistically significant in the original study.\n\n\n\n9.13.4 Open Questions\n\nWhat is meant with the statement ‘Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence’?\nWhat is the goal of an equivalence test?\nWhat is the difference between a nil null hypothesis and a non-nil null hypothesis?\nWhat is a minimal effect test?\nWhat conclusion can we draw if a null-hypothesis significance test and equivalence test are performed for the same data, and neither test is statistically significant?\nWhen designing equivalence tests to have a desired statistical power, why do you need a larger sample size, the narrower the equivalence range is?\nWhy is it incorrect to say there is ‘no effect’ when the equivalence test is statistically significant?\nSpecify one way in which the Bayesian ROPE procedure and an equivalence test are similar, and specify one way in which they are different.\nWhat are two approaches to specify a smallest effect size of interest?\nWhat is the idea behind the ‘small telescopes’ approach to equivalence testing?\n\n\n\n\n\nAbelson, P.

    "text": "10.1 Choosing alpha levels for sequential analyses.\nIf one would analyze the data at multiple looks without correcting the alpha level, the Type 1 error rate would inflate (Armitage et al., 1969). As Armitage and colleagues show, with equally spaced looks, the alpha level inflates to 0.142 after 5 looks, 0.374 after 100 looks, and 0.530 after 1000 looks. Looking at the data twice is conceptually similar to deciding if a result is significant if one of two dependent variables shows a statistically significant effect. However, an important difference is that in the case of sequential analyses the multiple tests are not independent, but dependent. A test at look 2 combines the old data collected at look 1 with the new data at look 2. This means the Type 1 error rate inflates less quickly compared to independent tests, and we will see below this enables more efficient and flexible solutions to controlling error rates.\nWhen controlling the Type 1 error rate in sequential analyses, a decision needs to be made about how to spend the alpha level across all looks at the data. For example, when a researcher plans a study with one interim look and one final look at the data, boundary critical Z-values need to be set for the first look (at n out of N observations) and the second look (at N observations). These two critical values, \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) (for the first and the second analysis) need to be chosen such that the overall probability (Pr) that the null hypothesis is rejected – when in the first analysis the observed Z-score is larger than the critical value for the first look, \\(Z_n\\) ≥ \\(c_1\\), and (if we did not reject the hypothesis in the first analysis, so \\(Z_n\\) &lt; \\(c_1\\), and we continue data collection) when in the second analysis the observed Z-score is larger than the critical value for the second look, \\(Z_N\\) ≥ \\(c_2\\) – equals the desired overall alpha level when the null hypothesis is true. In formal terms, for a directional test:\n\\[\nPr\\{Z_n \\geq c_1\\} + Pr\\{Z_n &lt; c_1, Z_N \\geq c_2\\} = \\alpha\n\\]\nWith more than one interim analysis, additional critical values have to be determined following the same rationale. If you combine multiple looks at the data with multiple comparisons, you would correct the alpha level twice, once for multiple comparisons, and then for multiple looks. Because the alpha level is corrected, it does not matter which statistical test you perform at each look, all that matters is that the p-value is compared to the corrected alpha level. The corrections discussed below are valid for any design where the data is normally distributed, and where each group of observations is independent of the previous group."

    "section": "\n10.2 The Pocock correction",
    "text": "10.2 The Pocock correction\nThe first decision researchers need to make is how they want to correct the Type I error rate across looks. Four common approaches are the Pocock correction, the O’Brien-Fleming correction, the Haybittle & Peto correction, and the Wang and Tsiatis approach. Users are also free to specify their own preferred way to spend the alpha level across looks.\nThe Pocock correction is the simplest way to correct the alpha level for multiple looks. Conceptually, it is very similar to the Bonferroni correction. The Pocock correction has been created such that the alpha level is identical for each look at the data, resulting in constant critical values (expressed as z values) \\(u_k = c\\) to reject the null hypothesis, \\(H_0\\), at look \\(k\\). The following code uses the package rpact to design a study for a sequential analysis:\n\nlibrary(rpact)\ndesign &lt;- getDesignGroupSequential(\n  kMax = 2,\n  typeOfDesign = \"P\",\n  sided = 2,\n  alpha = 0.05,\n  beta = 0.1\n)\ndesign\n\nDesign parameters and output of group sequential design:\n\nUser defined parameters:\n  Type of design                               : Pocock \n  Maximum number of stages                     : 2 \n  Stages                                       : 1, 2 \n  Significance level                           : 0.0500 \n  Type II error rate                           : 0.1000 \n  Test                                         : two-sided \n\nDerived from user defined parameters:\n  Information rates                            : 0.500, 1.000 \n\nDefault parameters:\n  Two-sided power                              : FALSE \n  Tolerance                                    : 0.00000001 \n\nOutput:\n  Cumulative alpha spending                    : 0.02939, 0.05000 \n  Critical values                              : 2.178, 2.178 \n  Stage levels (one-sided)                     : 0.01469, 0.01469 \n\n\nThe output tells us we have designed a study with 2 looks (one interim, one final) using the Pocock spending function. The last line returns one-sided alpha levels. The rpact package focuses on Confirmatory Adaptive Clinical Trial Design and Analysis. In clinical trials, researchers mostly test directional predictions, and thus, the default setting is to perform a one-sided test. In clinical trials it is common to use a 0.025 significance level for one-sided tests, but in many other fields, 0.05 is a more common default. We can get the two-sided alpha levels by multiplying the one-sided alpha levels by two:\n\ndesign$stageLevels * 2\n\n[1] 0.02938579 0.02938579\n\n\nWe can check the output against the Wikipedia page for the Pocock correction where we indeed see that with 2 looks at the data the alpha level for each look is 0.0294. The Pocock correction is slightly more efficient than using a Bonferroni correction (in which case the alpha levels would be 0.025), because of the dependency in the data (at the second look, the data analyzed at the first look is again part of the analysis).\nrpact makes it easy to plot the boundaries (based on the critical values) for each look. Looks are plotted as a function of the ‘Information Rate’, which is the percentage of the total data that has been collected at a look. In Figure 10.1 there are two equally spaced looks, so when 50% of the data has been collected (Information Rate 0.5) and when 100% of the data has been collected (Information Rate 1). We see the critical values (solid black lines) are larger than the 1.96 we would use for a fixed design with a 5% alpha level, namely Z = 2.178 (black dashed line). Whenever we observe a test statistic that is more extreme than these critical values at the first or second look, we can reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Plot of critical boundaries at each look for a 2 look design with a Pocock correction.\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis can also be performed in the rpact shiny app which also allows users to create all plots through simple menu options, and download a complete report of the analyses (e.g., for a preregistration document).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Screenshot of rpact Shiny app."

    "section": "\n10.3 Comparing Spending Functions",
    "text": "10.3 Comparing Spending Functions\nWe can visualize the corrections for different types of designs for each of 3 looks (2 interim looks and one final look) in the same plot (see Figure 10.3). The plot below shows the Pocock, O’Brien-Fleming, Haybittle-Peto, and Wang-Tsiatis correction with \\(\\Delta\\) = 0.25. We see that researchers can choose different approaches to spend their alpha level across looks. Researchers can choose to spend their alpha conservatively (keeping most of the alpha for the last look), or more liberally (spending more alpha at the earlier looks, which increases the probability of stopping early for many true effect sizes).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: our different spending functions for 3 looks: O’Brien-Fleming (OF), Pocock (P), Haybittle-Peto (HP), Wang-Tsiatis (WT).\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the O’Brien and Fleming correction is much more conservative at the first look but is close to the uncorrected critical value of 1.96 at the last look (the black dashed line - for two-sided tests all critical values are mirrored in the negative direction): 3.471, 2.454, and 2.004. The Pocock correction has the same critical value at each look (2.289, 2.289, and 2.289). The Haybittle and Peto correction has the same critical value at each look but the last (3, 3, and 1.975). With the Wang and Tsiatis correction, critical values decrease with each look (2.741, 2.305, and 2.083).\nBeing conservative during early looks is sensible if you mainly want to monitor the results for unexpected developments. A Pocock correction is more useful when there is substantial uncertainty both in whether an effect is present and how large the effect size is, as it gives a higher probability of stopping the experiment early if the effects are large. Because the statistical power of a test depends on the alpha level, lowering the alpha level at the final look means that the statistical power is lower compared to a fixed design, and that to achieve a desired power, the sample size of a study needs to be increased to maintain the same statistical power at the last look. This increase in sample size can be compensated by stopping data collection early, in which case a sequential design is more efficient than a fixed design. Because the alpha at the last look for O’Brien-Fleming or Haybittle-Peto designs are very similar to the statistical power for a fixed design with only one look, the required sample size is also very similar. The Pocock correction requires a larger increase in the maximum sample size to achieve the desired power compared to a fixed design.\nCorrected alpha levels can be computed to many digits, but this quickly reaches a level of precision that is meaningless in real life. The observed Type I error rate for all tests you will do in your lifetime is not noticeably different if you set the alpha level at 0.0194, 0.019, or 0.02 (see the concept of ‘significant digits’. Even as we calculate and use alpha thresholds up to many digits in sequential tests, the messiness of most research makes these alpha levels have false precision. Keep this in mind when interpreting your data."

    "section": "\n10.4 Alpha spending functions",
    "text": "10.4 Alpha spending functions\nThe approaches to specify the shape of decision boundaries across looks discussed so far have an important limitation (Proschan et al., 2006). They require a pre-specified number of looks (e.g., 4), and the sample size for the interim looks need to be pre-specified as well (e.g., after 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of observations). It is logistically not always feasible to stop the data collection exactly at 25% of the planned total sample size. An important contribution to the sequential testing literature was made by Lan and DeMets (1983) who introduced the alpha spending approach to correct the alpha level. In this approach the cumulative Type I error rate spent across the looks is pre-specified through a function (the alpha spending function) to control the overall significance level \\(\\alpha\\) at the end of the study.\nThe main benefit of these alpha spending functions is that error rates at interim analyses can be controlled, while neither the number nor the timing of the looks needs to be specified in advance. This makes alpha spending approaches much more flexible than earlier approaches to controlling the Type 1 error in group sequential designs. When using an alpha spending function it is important that the decision to perform an interim analysis is not based on collected data, as this can still increase the Type I error rate. As long as this assumption is met, it is possible to update the alpha levels at each look during a study.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.4: Comparison of Pocock (P) and O’Brien-Fleming correction (OF), Pocock-like (asP) and O’Brien-Fleming like (asOF) alpha spending functions, for 5 looks."

    "text": "10.5 Updating boundaries during a study\nAlthough alpha spending functions control the Type I error rate even when there are deviations from the pre-planned number of looks, or their timing, this does require recalculating the boundaries used in the statistical test based on the amount of information that has been observed. Let us assume a researcher designs a study with three equally spaced looks at the data (two interim looks, one final look), using a Pocock-type alpha spending function, where results will be analyzed in a two-sided t-test with an overall desired Type I error rate of 0.05, and a desired power of 0.9 for a Cohen’s d of 0.5. An a-priori power analysis (which we will explain in the next section) shows that we achieve the desired power in our sequential design if we plan to look after 65.4, 130.9, and 196.3 observations in each condition. Since we cannot collect partial participants, we should round these numbers up, and because we have 2 independent groups, we will collect 66 observations for look 1 (33 in each condition), 132 at the second look (66 in each condition) and 198 at the third look (99 in each condition). The code below computes the alpha levels at each look (or stage) for a two-sided test:\n\ndesign &lt;- getDesignGroupSequential(kMax = 3, \n                                   typeOfDesign = \"asP\",\n                                   sided = 2, \n                                   alpha = 0.05, \n                                   beta = 0.1)\ndesign$stageLevels * 2\n\n[1] 0.02264162 0.02173822 0.02167941\n\n\nNow imagine that due to logistical issues, we do not manage to analyze the data until we have collected data from 76 observations (38 in each condition) instead of the planned 66 observations. Such logistical issues are common in practice and one of the main reasons alpha spending functions for group sequential designs were developed. Our first look at the data does not occur at the planned time of collecting 33.3% of the total sample, but at 76/198 = 38.4% of the planned sample. We can recalculate the alpha level we should use for each look at the data, based on the current look, and planned future looks. Instead of using the alpha levels 0.0226, 0.0217, and 0.0217 at the three respective looks (as calculated above, and note how in the Pocock-like alpha spending function the alpha levels are almost, but not exactly, the same at each look, unlike the Pocock correction where they are identical at each look). We can adjust the information rates by explicitly specifying them using informationRates in the code below. The first look now occurs at 76/198 of the planned sample. The second look is still planned to occur at 2/3 of the sample, and the final look at the planned maximum sample size.\n\ndesign &lt;- getDesignGroupSequential(\n  typeOfDesign = \"asP\", \n  informationRates = c(76/198, 2/3, 1), \n  alpha = 0.05, \n  sided = 2)\ndesign$stageLevels * 2\n\n[1] 0.02532710 0.02043978 0.02164755\n\n\nThe updated alpha levels are 0.0253 for the current look, 0.0204 for the second look, and 0.0216 for the final look. The alpha level we will use for the first look is therefore not 0.0226 (as originally planned) but the slightly higher 0.0253. The second look will now use a slightly lower alpha of 0.0204 instead of 0.0217. The differences are small, but the fact that there is a formal method to control the alpha level that provides the flexibility to look at different times than originally planned is extremely useful.\nIt is also possible to correct the alpha level if the final look at the data changes, for example because you are not able to collect the intended sample size, or because due to unforeseen circumstances you collect more data than planned. This is nowadays increasingly common as people preregister their studies, or publish using Registered Reports. Sometimes they end up with slightly more data than planned, which raises the question is they should analyze the planned sample size, or all the data. Analyzing all the collected data prevents wasting responses from participants, and uses all the information available, but it increases the flexibility in the data analysis (as researchers can now choose to analyze either the data from the planned sample, or all the data they have collected). Alpha spending functions solve this conundrum by allowing researchers to analyze all the data, while updating the alpha level that is used to control the overall alpha level.\nIf more data is collected than was planned, we can no longer use the alpha spending function that was chosen (i.e., the Pocock spending function), and instead have to provide a user-defined alpha spending function by updating the timing and alpha spending function to reflect the data collection as it actually occurred up to the final look. Assuming the second look in our earlier example occurred as originally planned at 2/3 of the data we planned to collect, but the last look occurred at 206 participants instead of 198, we can compute an updated alpha level for the last look. Given the current total sample size, we need to recompute the alpha levels for the earlier looks, which now occurred at 76/206 = 0.369, 132/206 = 0.641, and for the last look at 206/206 = 1.\nThe first and second look occurred with the adjusted alpha levels we computed after the first adjustment (alpha levels of 0.0253 and 0.0204). We have already spent part of our total alpha at the first two looks. We can look at the “Cumulative alpha spent’ in the results from the design we specified above, and see how much of our Type I error rate we spent so far:\n\ndesign$alphaSpent\n\n[1] 0.02532710 0.03816913 0.05000000\n\n\nWe see that we have spent 0.0253 after look 1, and 0.0382 after look 2. We also know we want to spend the remainder of our Type I error rate at the last look, for a total of 0.05.\nOur actual alpha spending function is no longer captured by the Pocock spending function after collecting more data than planned, so instead we specify a user defined spending function. We can perform these calculations using the code below by specifying the userAlphaSpending information, after choosing the asUser design:\n\ndesign &lt;- getDesignGroupSequential(\n  typeOfDesign = \"asUser\", \n  informationRates = c(72/206, 132/206, 1), \n  alpha = 0.05, \n  sided = 2, \n  userAlphaSpending = c(0.0253, 0.0382, 0.05)\n)\ndesign$stageLevels * 2\n\n[1] 0.02530000 0.01987072 0.02075796\n\n\nThe alpha levels for looks in the past do not correspond with the alpha levels we used, but the final alpha level (0.0208) gives the alpha level we should use for our final analysis based on a sample size that is larger than what we planned to collect. The difference with the alpha level we would have used if we collected the planned sample size is really small (0.0216 vs. 0.0208), in part because we did not miss the planned sample size by a lot. Such small differences in alpha levels will not really be noticeable in practice, but it is very useful that there is a formally correct solution to deal with collecting more data than planned, while controlling the Type 1 error rate. If you use sequential designs, you can use these corrections whenever you overshoot the sample size you planned to collect in a preregistration."

    "text": "10.6 Sample Size for Sequential Designs\nAt the final look, sequential designs require somewhat more participants than a fixed design, depending on how much the alpha level at this look is lowered due to the correction for multiple comparisons. That said, due to early stopping, sequential designs will on average require less participants. Let’s first examine how many participants we would need in a fixed design, where we only analyze our data once. We have an alpha level of 0.05, and a Type 2 (beta) error of 0.1 - in other words, the desired power is 90%. We will perform one test, and assuming a normal distribution our critical Z-score would be 1.96, for an alpha level of 5%.\n\ndesign &lt;- getDesignGroupSequential(\n  kMax = 1,\n  typeOfDesign = \"P\",\n  sided = 2,\n  alpha = 0.05,\n  beta = 0.1\n)\n\npower_res &lt;- getSampleSizeMeans(\n  design = design,\n  groups = 2,\n  alternative = 0.5, \n  stDev = 1, \n  allocationRatioPlanned = 1,\n  normalApproximation = FALSE)\n\npower_res\n\nDesign plan parameters and output for means:\n\nDesign parameters:\n  Critical values                              : 1.96 \n  Two-sided power                              : FALSE \n  Significance level                           : 0.0500 \n  Type II error rate                           : 0.1000 \n  Test                                         : two-sided \n\nUser defined parameters:\n  Alternatives                                 : 0.5 \n\nDefault parameters:\n  Mean ratio                                   : FALSE \n  Theta H0                                     : 0 \n  Normal approximation                         : FALSE \n  Standard deviation                           : 1 \n  Treatment groups                             : 2 \n  Planned allocation ratio                     : 1 \n\nSample size and output:\n  Number of subjects fixed                     : 170.1 \n  Number of subjects fixed (1)                 : 85 \n  Number of subjects fixed (2)                 : 85 \n  Lower critical values (treatment effect scale) : -0.303 \n  Upper critical values (treatment effect scale) : 0.303 \n  Local two-sided significance levels          : 0.0500 \n\nLegend:\n  (i): values of treatment arm i\n\n\nWe see that we need 85 participants in each group, (or 86, since the sample size is actually 85.03 and the required number of observations is rounded up, and so we need 172 participants in total. Other power analysis software, such as G*Power, should yield the same required sample size. We can now examine our design above with 2 looks and a Pocock-like alpha spending function for a 2 sided test with an alpha of 0.05.

This is a consequence of lowering our alpha level at each look (from 0.05 to 0.028). To compensate for the lower alpha level, we need to increase the sample size of the study to achieve the same power.\nHowever, the maximum sample size is not the expected sample size for this design, because of the possibility that we can stop data collection at an earlier look in the sequential design. In the long run, if d = 0.5, and we use an Pocock-like alpha spending function, and ignoring upward rounding because we can only collect a complete number of observations, we will sometimes collect 96 participants and stop after the first look, and the remaining time continue to 190 participants. As we see in the rows ‘Reject per stage’ the data collection is expected to stop after the first look in 0.6 of the studies because we have observed a significant result. The remainder of the time (1 - 0.6) = 0.4.\nThis means that, assuming there is a true effect of d = 0.5, the expected sample size on average is the probability of stopping at each look, multiplied by the number of observations we collect at each look, so 0.6 * 96 + 0.3 * 190 = 133.39. The rpact package returns 132.06 under “Expected number of subjects under \\(H_1\\)” - the small difference is due to the fact that rpact does not round the number of observations up, although it should). So, assuming the true effect is d = 0.5, in any single study we might need to collect slightly more data than in a fixed design (where we would collect 172), but on average we will need to collect less observations in a sequential design.\nBecause power is a curve, and the true effect size is unknown, it is useful to plot power across a range of possible effect sizes, so that we can explore the expected sample size, in the long run, if we use a sequential design, for different true effect sizes.\n\n# Use getPowerMeans and set max N to 190 based on analysis above\nsample_res &lt;- getPowerMeans(\n  design = seq_design,\n  groups = 2,\n  alternative = seq(0, 1, 0.01), \n  stDev = 1, \n  allocationRatioPlanned = 1,\n  maxNumberOfSubjects = 190, \n  normalApproximation = FALSE)\n\nplot(sample_res, type = 6)\n\n\n\nFigure 10.5: Power curve for a sequential design with 2 looks.\n\n\n\n\nThe blue line in Figure 10.5 indicates the expected number of observations we need to collect. Not surprisingly, when the true effect size is 0, we will almost always continue data collection to the end. We will only stop if we observe a Type 1 error, which is rare, and thus the expected number of observations is very close to the maximum sample size we are willing to collect. On the other side of the graph we see the scenario for when the true effect size is d = 1. With such a large effect size, we will have high power at our first look, and we will almost always be able to stop at the first look. The red line indicates the power at the final look, and the green line indicates the probability of stopping early.\nThe Pocock correction leads to a substantially lower alpha level at the last look, which requires an increase in sample size to compensate. As we saw before, the O’Brien-Fleming spending function does not require such a severe reduction in the alpha level at the last look. As the power analysis below shows, with 2 looks, this design would not need an increase in sample size at all in practice.\n\nseq_design &lt;- getDesignGroupSequential(\n  kMax = 2,\n  typeOfDesign = \"asOF\",\n  sided = 2,\n  alpha = 0.05,\n  beta = 0.1\n  )\n\n# Compute the sample size we need\npower_res_seq &lt;- getSampleSizeMeans(\n  design = seq_design,\n  groups = 2,\n  alternative = 0.5, \n  stDev = 1, \n  allocationRatioPlanned = 1,\n  normalApproximation = FALSE)\n\nsummary(power_res_seq)\n\nSample size calculation for a continuous endpoint\n\nSequential analysis with a maximum of 2 looks (group sequential design), overall \nsignificance level 5% (two-sided).\nThe sample size was calculated for a two-sample t-test, H0: mu(1) - mu(2) = 0, \nH1: effect = 0.5, standard deviation = 1, power 90%.\n\nStage                                         1      2 \nInformation rate                            50%   100% \nEfficacy boundary (z-value scale)         2.963  1.969 \nOverall power                            0.2525 0.9000 \nExpected number of subjects               149.1 \nNumber of subjects                         85.3  170.6 \nCumulative alpha spent                   0.0031 0.0500 \nTwo-sided local significance level       0.0031 0.0490 \nLower efficacy boundary (t)              -0.661 -0.304 \nUpper efficacy boundary (t)               0.661  0.304 \nExit probability for efficacy (under H0) 0.0031 \nExit probability for efficacy (under H1) 0.2525 \n\nLegend:\n  (t): treatment effect scale\n\n\nThis design meets the desired power when we collect 172 participants - exactly as many as when we would not look at the data once. We basically get a free look at the data, with the expected number of participants (assuming d = 0.5) dropping to 149.1. Increasing the number of looks to 4 comes at only a very small required increase in the number of participants to maintain the same statistical power, but further decreases the expected sample size. Especially for a conservative a-priori power analysis, or when performing an a-priori power analysis for a smallest effect size of interest, and there is a decent probability that the true effect size is larger, using sequential analysis is a very attractive option."

    "section": "\n10.7 Stopping for futility",
    "text": "10.7 Stopping for futility\nSo far, the sequential designs we have discussed would only stop at an interim analysis if we can reject \\(H_0\\). A well-designed study also takes into account the possibility that there is no effect, as we discussed in the chapter on equivalence testing. In the sequential analysis literature, stopping to reject the presence of the smallest effect size of interest is called stopping for futility. In the most extreme case, it could be impossible after an interim analysis that the final analysis will yield a statistically significant result. To illustrate this in a hypothetical scenario, imagine that after collecting 182 out of 192 observations, the observed mean difference between two independent conditions is 0.1, while the study was designed with the idea that the smallest effect deemed worthwhile is a mean difference of 0.5. If the primary dependent variable is measured on a 7 point Likert scale, it might be that even if every of the remaining 5 participants in the control condition answers 1, and every of the remaining participants in the experimental condition answers 7, the effect size after 192 observations will not yield p &lt; \\(\\alpha\\). If the goal of your study was to detect whether there was an effect of at least a mean difference of 0.5, at this point a researcher knows that goal will not be reached. Stopping a study at an interim analysis because the final result cannot yield a significant effect is called non-stochastic curtailment.\nIn less extreme but more common situations, it might still be possible for the study to observe a significant effect, but the probability might be very small. The probability of finding a significant result, given the data that have been observed up to an interim analysis, is called conditional power. Performing the conditional power analysis on the effect size that was originally expected might be too optimistic, but it is also undesirable to use the observed effect size, which typically has quite some uncertainty. One proposal is to update the expected effect size based on the observed data. If a Bayesian updating procedure is used, this is called predictive power (Spiegelhalter et al., 1986). It is possible to use adaptive designs that allow researchers to increase the final number of observations based on an interim analysis without inflating the Type 1 error rate (see Wassmer & Brannath (2016)).\nAlternatively, if the observed effect size is smaller than expected, one might want to stop for futility. As an illustration of a simple stopping rule for futility, imagine a researcher who will stop for futility whenever the observed effect size is is either zero, or in the opposite direction as was predicted. In Figure 10.6 the red line indicates critical values to declare a significant effect. In essence, this means that if the observed z-score for the interim test is either 0 or negative, data collection will be terminated. This can be specified by adding futilityBounds = c(0, 0) to the specification of the sequential design. One can choose in advance to stop whenever the criteria to stop for futility have been met, (i.e., a binding futility rule), but it is typically recommended to allow the possibility to continue data collection (i.e., a non-binding futility rule, specified by setting bindingFutility = FALSE).\n\ndesign &lt;- getDesignGroupSequential(\n  sided = 1,\n  alpha = 0.05,\n  beta = 0.1,\n  typeOfDesign = \"asP\",\n  futilityBounds = c(0, 0),\n  bindingFutility = FALSE\n)\n\nIn Figure 10.6 we see a sequential design where data collection is stopped to reject \\(H_0\\) when the observed z-score is larger than the values indicated by the red line, computed based on a Pocock-like alpha spending function (as in Figure 10.3). In addition, data collection will stop when at an interim analysis a z-score lower than or equal to 0 is observed, as indicated by the blue line. At the last look, the red and blue lines meet, because we will either reject \\(H_0\\) at the critical value, or fail to reject \\(H_0\\).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.6: Pocock-type boundaries for 3 looks to stop when rejecting \\(H_0\\) (red line) or to stop for futility (blue line) when the observed effect is in the opposite direction.\n\n\n\n\nManually specifying the futility bounds is not ideal, as we risk stopping data collection because we fail to reject \\(H_0\\), when there is a high probability of a Type 2 error. It is better to set the futility bounds by directly controlling the Type 2 error across looks at the data. Just as we are willing to distribute our Type I error rate across interim analyses, we can distribute our Type II error rate across looks, and decide to stop for futility when we fail to reject the effect size of interest with a desired Type 2 error rate.\nWhen a study is designed such that the null hypothesis significance test has 90% power to detect an effect of d = 0.5, 10% of the time \\(H_0\\) will not be rejected when it should. In these 10% of cases where we make a Type 2 error, the conclusion will be that an effect of 0.5 is not present, when in reality, there is an effect of d = 0.5 (or larger). In an equivalence against a smallest effect size of interest of d = 0.5, the conclusion that an effect of 0.5 or larger is not present, when in reality there is an effect of d = 0.5 (or larger), is called a Type 1 error: We incorrectly conclude the effect is practically equivalent to zero. Therefore, what is a Type 2 error in NHST when \\(H_0\\) is d = 0 and \\(H_1\\) = d = 0.5 is a Type 1 error in an equivalence test where \\(H_0\\) is d = 0.5 and \\(H_1\\) is d = 0 (Jennison & Turnbull, 2000). Controlling the Type 2 error in a sequential design can therefore be seen as controlling the Type 1 error for an equivalence test against the effect size the study is powered for. If we design a study to have a 5% Type 1 error rate and equally low Type 2 error rate (e.g., 5%, or 95% power), the study is an informative test for the presence or the absence of an effect of interest.\nIf the true effect size is (close to) 0, sequential designs that stop for futility are more efficient than designs that do not stop for futility. Adding futility bounds based on beta-spending functions reduces power, which needs to be compensated by increasing the sample size, but this can be compensated by the fact that studies can stop earlier for futility, which can make designs more efficient. When specifying a smallest effect size of interest is not possible, researchers might not want to incorporate stopping for futility into the study design. To control the Type 2 error rate across looks, a beta-spending function needs to be chosen, such as a Pocock type beta spending function, an O’Brien-Fleming type beta spending function, or a user defined beta spending function. For example, a Pocock-like beta-spending function is added through typeBetaSpending = “bsP”. The beta-spending function does not need to be the same as the alpha-spending function. In rpact beta-spending functions can only be chosen for directional (one-sided) tests. After all, you can consider an effect in both directions support for your hypothesis, and an effect in the opposite direction as a reason to reject the alternative hypothesis.\n\ndesign &lt;- getDesignGroupSequential(\n  kMax = 2,\n  typeOfDesign = \"asP\",\n  sided = 1,\n  alpha = 0.05,\n  beta = 0.1,\n  typeBetaSpending = \"bsP\",\n  bindingFutility = FALSE\n  )\n\nplot(design)\n\n\n\nFigure 10.7: Pocock-type boundaries for 3 looks to stop when rejecting \\(H_0\\) (red line) or to stop for futility (blue line) based on a Pocock-type beta-spending function.\n\n\n\n\nWith a beta-spending function, the expected number of subjects under \\(H_1\\) will increase, so if the alternative hypothesis is true, designing a study to be able to stop for futility comes at a cost. However, it is possible that \\(H_0\\) is true, and when it is, stopping for futility reduces the expected sample size. In Figure 10.8 you can see that the probability of stopping (the green line) is now also high when the true effect size is 0, as we will now stop for futility, and if we do, the expected sample size (the blue line) is lower compared to Figure 10.5. It is important to design studies that have a high informational value to reject the presence of a meaningful effect at the final analysis, but whether stopping for futility early is an option you want to build into a study is a choice that requires considering the probability that the null hypothesis is true and a (perhaps small) increase in the sample size.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.8: Power curve for a sequential design with 2 looks with stopping for futility."

    "text": "10.8 Reporting the results of a sequential analysis\nGroup sequential designs have been developed to efficiently test hypotheses using the Neyman-Pearson approach for statistical inference, where the goal is to decide how to act, while controlling error rates in the long run. Group sequential designs do not have the goal to quantify the strength of evidence, or provide accurate estimates of the effect size (Proschan et al., 2006). Nevertheless, after having reached a conclusion about whether a hypothesis can be rejected or not, researchers will often want to also interpret the effect size estimate when reporting results.\nA challenge when interpreting the observed effect size in sequential designs is that whenever a study is stopped early when \\(H_0\\) is rejected, there is a risk that the data analysis was stopped because, due to random variation, a large effect size was observed at the time of the interim analysis. This means that the observed effect size at these interim analyses over-estimates the true effect size. As Schönbrodt et al. (2017) show, a meta-analysis of studies that used sequential designs will yield an accurate effect size, because studies that stop early have smaller sample sizes, and are weighted less, which is compensated by the smaller effect size estimates in those sequential studies that reach the final look, and are weighted more because of their larger sample size. However, researchers might want to interpret effect sizes from single studies before a meta-analysis can be performed, and in this case, reporting an adjusted effect size estimate can be useful. Although sequential analysis software only allows one to compute adjusted effect size estimates for certain statistical tests, we recommend reporting both the adjusted effect size where possible, and to always also report the unadjusted effect size estimate for future meta-analyses.\nA similar issue is at play when reporting p values and confidence intervals. When a sequential design is used, the distribution of a p value that does not account for the sequential nature of the design is no longer uniform when \\(H_0\\) is true. A p value is the probability of observing a result at least as extreme as the result that was observed, given that \\(H_0\\) is true. It is no longer straightforward to determine what ‘at least as extreme’ means a sequential design (Cook, 2002). The most widely recommended procedure to determine what “at least as extreme” means is to order the outcomes of a series of sequential analyses in terms of the look at which the study was stopped, where earlier stopping is more extreme than later stopping, and where studies with higher z values are more extreme, when different studies are stopped at the same time (Proschan et al., 2006). This is referred to as stagewise ordering, which treats rejections at earlier looks as stronger evidence against \\(H_0\\) than rejections later in the study (Wassmer & Brannath, 2016). Given the direct relationship between a p value and a confidence interval, confidence intervals for sequential designs have also been developed.\nReporting adjusted p values and confidence intervals, however, might be criticized. After a sequential design, a correct interpretation from a Neyman-Pearson framework is to conclude that \\(H_0\\) is rejected, the alternative hypothesis is rejected, or that the results are inconclusive. The reason that adjusted p values are reported after sequential designs is to allow readers to interpret them as a measure of evidence. Dupont (1983) provides good arguments to doubt that adjusted p values provide a valid measure of the strength of evidence. Furthermore, a strict interpretation of the Neyman-Pearson approach to statistical inferences also provides an argument against interpreting p values as measures of evidence (Lakens, 2022). Therefore, it is recommended, if researchers are interested in communicating the evidence in the data for \\(H_0\\) relative to the alternative hypothesis, to report likelihoods or Bayes factors, which can always be reported and interpreted after the data collection has been completed. Reporting the unadjusted p-value in relation to the alpha level communicates the basis to reject hypotheses, although it might be important for researchers performing a meta-analysis based on p-values (e.g., a p-curve or z-curve analysis, as explained in the chapter on bias detection) that these are sequential p-values. Adjusted confidence intervals are useful tools to evaluate the observed effect estimate relative to its variability at an interim or the final look at the data. Note that the adjusted parameter estimates are only available in statistical software for a few commonly used designs in pharmaceutical trials, such as comparisons of mean differences between groups, or survuval analysis.\nBelow, we see the same sequential design we started with, with 2 looks and a Pocock-type alpha spending function. After completing the study with the planned sample size of 95 participants per condition (where we collect 48 participants at look 1, and the remaining 47 at look 2), we can now enter the observed data using the function getDataset. The means and standard deviations are entered for each stage, so at the second look, only the data from the second 95 participants in each condition are used to compute the means (1.51 and 1.01) and standard deviations (1.03 and 0.96).\n\ndesign &lt;- getDesignGroupSequential(\n  kMax = 2,\n  typeOfDesign = \"asP\",\n  sided = 2,\n  alpha = 0.05,\n  beta = 0.1\n)\n\ndataMeans &lt;- getDataset(\n  n1 = c(48, 47), \n  n2 = c(48, 47), \n  means1 = c(1.12, 1.51), # for directional test, means 1 &gt; means 2\n  means2 = c(1.03, 1.01),\n  stDevs1 = c(0.98, 1.03), \n  stDevs2 = c(1.06, 0.96)\n  )\n\nres &lt;- getAnalysisResults(\n  design, \n  equalVariances = TRUE,\n  dataInput = dataMeans\n  )\n\nres\n\n\n\n[PROGRESS] Stage results calculated [0.0386 secs] \n[PROGRESS] Conditional power calculated [0.0377 secs] \n[PROGRESS] Conditional rejection probabilities (CRP) calculated [0.0018 secs] \n[PROGRESS] Repeated confidence interval of stage 1 calculated [0.5737 secs] \n[PROGRESS] Repeated confidence interval of stage 2 calculated [0.7239 secs] \n[PROGRESS] Repeated confidence interval calculated [1.3 secs] \n[PROGRESS] Repeated p-values of stage 1 calculated [0.2843 secs] \n[PROGRESS] Repeated p-values of stage 2 calculated [0.2845 secs] \n[PROGRESS] Repeated p-values calculated [0.5707 secs] \n[PROGRESS] Final p-value calculated [0.0025 secs] \n[PROGRESS] Final confidence interval calculated [0.0787 secs] \n\n\n\n\nAnalysis results (means of 2 groups, group sequential design):\n\nDesign parameters:\n  Information rates                            : 0.500, 1.000 \n  Critical values                              : 2.157, 2.201 \n  Futility bounds (non-binding)                : -Inf \n  Cumulative alpha spending                    : 0.03101, 0.05000 \n  Local one-sided significance levels          : 0.01550, 0.01387 \n  Significance level                           : 0.0500 \n  Test                                         : two-sided \n\nUser defined parameters: not available\n\nDefault parameters:\n  Normal approximation                         : FALSE \n  Direction upper                              : TRUE \n  Theta H0                                     : 0 \n  Equal variances                              : TRUE \n\nStage results:\n  Cumulative effect sizes                      : 0.0900, 0.2928 \n  Cumulative (pooled) standard deviations      : 1.021, 1.013 \n  Stage-wise test statistics                   : 0.432, 2.435 \n  Stage-wise p-values                          : 0.333390, 0.008421 \n  Overall test statistics                      : 0.432, 1.993 \n  Overall p-values                             : 0.33339, 0.02384 \n\nAnalysis results:\n  Assumed standard deviation                   : 1.013 \n  Actions                                      : continue, accept \n  Conditional rejection probability            : 0.007317, NA \n  Conditional power                            : NA, NA \n  Repeated confidence intervals (lower)        : -0.36630, -0.03306 \n  Repeated confidence intervals (upper)        : 0.5463, 0.6187 \n  Repeated p-values                            : &gt;0.5, 0.08195 \n  Final stage                                  : 2 \n  Final p-value                                : NA, 0.06662 \n  Final CIs (lower)                            : NA, -0.02007 \n  Final CIs (upper)                            : NA, 0.5734 \n  Median unbiased estimate                     : NA, 0.2814 \n\n\nImagine we have performed a study planned to have at most 2 equally spaced looks at the data, where we perform a two-sided test with an alpha of 0.05, and we use a Pocock type alpha spending function, and we observe mean differences between the two conditions at the last look. Based on a Pocock-like alpha spending function with two equally spaced looks the alpha level for a two-sided t-test is 0.003051, and 0.0490. We can thus reject \\(H_0\\) after look 2. But we would also like to report an effect size, and adjusted p values and confidence intervals.\nThe results show that the action after look 1 was to continue data collection, and that we could reject \\(H_0\\) at the second look. The unadjusted mean difference is provided in the row “Overall effect size” and at the final look this was 0.293. The adjusted mean difference is provided in the row “Median unbiased estimate” and is lower, and the adjusted confidence interval is in the row “Final confidence interval”, giving the result 0.281, 95% CI [-0.02, 0.573].\nThe unadjusted p values for a one-sided test are reported in the row “Overall p-value”. The actual p values for our two-sided test would be twice as large, so 0.6668, 0.0477. The adjusted p-value at the final look is provided in the row “Final p-value” and it is 0.06662."

    "text": "10.9 Test Yourself\n\nQ1: Sequential analyses can increase the efficiency of the studies you perform. Which statement is true for a sequential design in which researchers only stop if \\(H_0\\) can be rejected (and did not specify a rule to stop for futility)?\n\n\nSequential analyses will reduce the sample size of every study you will perform. Sequential analyses will on average reduce the sample size of studies you will perform.Sequential analyses will on average reduce the sample size of studies you will perform, as long as there is a true effect (when a rule to stop for futility has not been specified). Sequential analyses will on average require the same sample size as fixed designs, but offer more flexibility. \n\n\nQ2: What is the difference between sequential analysis and optional stopping?\n\n\nThe only difference is that a sequential analysis is transparently reporting, while optional stopping is typically not disclosed in a paper. In sequential analysis the Type 1 error rate is controlled, while in optional stopping the Type 1 error rate is inflated. In optional stopping data collection is only terminated when a significant result has been observed, while in sequential analysis data collection can also stop when the absence of a meaningful effect has been established.In sequential analysis it is not possible to design a study where you analyze the data after every participant, while you can do this in optional stopping.\n\n\nQ3: What is the defining feature of the Pocock correction?\n\n\nIt uses a very conservative alpha level for early looks, and the alpha level at the last look is close to the unadjusted alpha level in a fixed design. It uses the same alpha level at each look (or almost the same alpha level at each look, when using an Pocock-like alpha spending function). It uses a critical value of 3 at each interim analysis, and spends the remaining Type 1 error rate at the last look. It has a parameter that can be chosen such that the Type 1 error rate is spent more conservatively or more liberally in early interim analyses. \n\n\nQ4: A benefit of the O’Brien-Fleming correction is that the alpha level at the last look is close to the alpha level. Why is this a benefit?\n\n\nIt means that the sample size based on an a-priori power analysis (which depends on the alpha level) is close to the sample size in a fixed design, while allowing additional looks at the data. It means the Type 1 error rate is inflated only a little bit, compared to a fixed design. It means the Type 1 error rate is only a bit more conservative, compared to a fixed design.It means that the sample size based on an a-priori power analysis (which depends on the alpha level) is always identical to the sample size in a fixed design, while allowing additional looks at the data. \n\n\nQ5: A researcher uses a sequential design for a study with 5 looks at the data, with a desired overall alpha level of 0.05 for a two-sided test, and chooses a Pocock correction. After continuing data collect to the third look, the researcher observes a p-value of 0.011. Which statement is true? Note: remember that rpact returns one-sided alpha levels. You can use the following code by replacing 0 and specifying the typeOfDesign:\n\ndesign &lt;- rpact::getDesignGroupSequential(\n  kMax = 0,\n  typeOfDesign = \"\",\n  sided = 0,\n  alpha = 0.0\n)\ndesign\n\n\n\nThe researcher can reject the null hypothesis and can terminate data collection.The researcher fails to reject the null hypothesis and needs to continue the data collection.\n\n\nQ6: A researcher uses a sequential design for a study with 5 looks at the data, with a desired overall alpha level of 0.05, and chooses an O’Brien-Fleming correction. After continuing data collect to the third look, the researcher observes a p-value of 0.011. Which statement is true (you can use the same code as for Q5)?\n\n\nThe researcher can reject the null hypothesis and can terminate data collection.The researcher fails to reject the null hypothesis and needs to continue the data collection.\n\n\nQ7: For the design in Q5 (using the Pocock correction), what is the sample size required to achieve 80% power (the default – you can change the default by specifying a different value than beta = 0.2 in the getDesignGroupSequential function) for an effect size of d = 0.5 (which equals a mean difference of 0.5 with a standard deviation of 1). You can use the code below.\n\ndesign &lt;- rpact::getDesignGroupSequential(\n  kMax = 5,\n  typeOfDesign = \"OF\",\n  sided = 2,\n  alpha = 0.05\n)\n\npower_res &lt;- rpact::getSampleSizeMeans(\n  design = design,\n  groups = 2,\n  alternative = 0.5, \n  stDev = 1, \n  allocationRatioPlanned = 1,\n  normalApproximation = FALSE)\n\npower_res\n\n\n\n64 (32 in each independent group)128 (64 in each independent group)154 (77 in each independent group)158 (79 in each independent group)\n\n\nQ8: For the design in the previous question, what is the sample size required to achieve 80% power for an effect size of d = 0.5 for a fixed design with only one look instead of 5? First update the design (by changing the kMax to 1) and then re-run the code provided with the previous question.\n\n\n64 (32 in each independent group)128 (64 in each independent group)154 (77 in each independent group)158 (79 in each independent group)\n\n\nWe see the sample size increases quite a bit because of the choice for the Pocock correction, and the number of looks (5, which lead to a low alpha level at the final look). The ratio of the maximum sample size for a sequential design and the sample size for a fixed design is known as the inflation factor, which is independent of the effect size. Although a-priori power analyses have not been programmed for all types of tests, the inflation factor can be used to compute the increased number of observations that is required relative to a fixed design for any test. Researchers can perform an a-priori power analysis for a fixed design with any tool they would normally use, and multiply the total number of observations with the inflation factor to determine the required sample size for a sequential design. The inflation factor can be retrieved using the getDesignCharacteristics function.\nQ9: First, re-run the code to create a sequential design with 5 looks and a Pocock correction at the data used in Q7. Then, run the code below, and find the inflation factor. What is the inflation factor, or the required increase in the sample size for a sequential design with 5 looks using the Pocock correction, compared to a fixed design? Note that rpact does not round up the number of observations for per group to whole numbers when calculating the inflation factor.\n\nrpact::getDesignCharacteristics(design)\n\n\n\nThe inflation factor is 1The inflation factor is 1.0284The inflation factor is 1.2286The inflation factor is 1.2536\n\n\nQ10: We see the inflation factor is quite large, and there is a certain probability that we will have to collect more observations than using a fixed design. Re-run the code for Q7 (for the Pocock design with 5 looks). We see that on average, if there is a true effect of 0.5, we will be more efficient than in a fixed design. What is the expected number of subjects under \\(H_1\\), as provided by rpact?\n\n\n101.9104.3125.3152.8\n\n\nWe see the sequential design will on average be more efficient than a fixed design, but the decision about the trade-off between the specific sequential design used, and whether the possible benefit is worth the risk of collecting additional data, must be made on a case-by-case basis.\nQ11: First, change the code to create a sequential design with 5 looks at the data used in Q7 from the Pocock correction to the OF (O’Brien-Fleming) correction. Then, run the code in question 9 again, and find the inflation factor for this design. What is the inflation factor?\n\n\nThe inflation factor is 1The inflation factor is 1.0284The inflation factor is 1.2286The inflation factor is 1.2536\n\n\nQ12: It is also possible to stop for futility (or to reject the presence of a specific effect of interest). Researchers should decide between binding and non-binding beta-spending functions, but they do not need to decide between binding and non-binding alpha spending functions. If a researcher observed a statistically significant result at an interim analysis, but decides not to stop the data collection, but continue the data collection (for example to get a more precise effect size estimate) what are the consequences?\n\n\nThe Type 1 error rate will inflate, and the Type 2 error rate will inflate.The Type 1 error rate will inflate, and the Type 2 error rate will not inflate. The Type 1 error rate will not inflate, and the Type 2 error rate will inflate. vThe Type 1 error rate will not inflate, and the Type 2 error rate will not inflate. \n\n\nQ13: In the plot below you see the t-score boundaries for a sequential design to stop to reject \\(H_0\\) (the red line) and to reject \\(H_1\\) (the blue line). At the second interim look, you perform a test, and observe a t-value of 2. Which decision would you make?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.9: Example of O’Brien-Fleming-type boundaries for 3 looks to stop when rejecting \\(H_0\\) (red line) or to stop for futility (blue line) with a 5% Type 1 and Type 2 error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can reject \\(H_0\\) and stop data collection.You can reject \\(H_1\\) and stop data collection.You reject both \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) and stop data collection.You fail to reject both \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) and continue data collection.\n\n\n\n\n10.9.1 Open Questions\n\nWhat is the difference between sequential analysis and optional stopping?\nWhat is a possible benefit of using a sequential design over a fixed design?\nWhat does it mean to stop data collection for futility?\nWhat is the difference in the philosophy of how the alpha is spent across looks between the Pocock and O’Brien-Fleming approaches?\nWhat is the benefit of the fact that the alpha level at the final look when using an O’Brien-Fleming correction is close to the uncorrected alpha level?\nWhat is the difference between the Pocock and O’Brien-Fleming correction, and the corresponding Pocock and O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending functions developed by Lan and DeMets?\nHow can it be that even though the maximum sample size for a sequential design is slightly larger than the sample size for a fixed design, sequential designs can still be more efficient?\nWhen does incorporating a stopping rule for futility increase the efficiency of a sequential design?\nOn average, what is the effect of stopping early in a sequential design on the effect size estimate?

    "text": "11.1 Random Variation\nPeople find it difficult to think about random variation. Our mind is more strongly geared towards recognizing patterns than randomness. In this section, the goal is to learn what random variation looks like, and how the number of observations collected determines the amount of variation.\nIntelligence tests have been designed such that the mean Intelligence Quotient of the entire population of adults is 100, with a standard deviation of 15. This will not be true for every sample we draw from the population. Let’s get a feel for what the IQ scores from a sample look like. Which IQ scores will people in our sample have?\nWe will start by manually calculating the mean and standard deviation of a random sample of 10 individuals. Their IQ scores are: 91.15, 86.52, 75.64, 115.72, 95.83, 105.44, 87.10, 100.81, 82.63, and 106.22. If we sum these 10 scores and divide them by 10, we get the mean of our sample: 94.71. We can also calculate the standard deviation from our sample. First, we subtract the overall mean (94.71) from each individual IQ score. Then, we square these differences and then sum these squared differences (giving 1374.79). We divide this sum of the squared difference by the sample size minus 1 (10-1=9), and finally take the square root of this value, which gives the standard deviation: 12.36. Copy the code below, remove the set.seed(3190) line (which makes the code reproducible but creates the same data as in the plot below each time) and run it to randomly simulate 10 IQ scores and plot them.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nset.seed(3190) # set seed for reproducibility\nn &lt;- 10 # set sample size\nx &lt;- rnorm(n = n, mean = 100, sd = 15) # simulate data\n\n# plot data adding normal distribution and annotations\nggplot(as.data.frame(x), aes(x)) +\n  geom_histogram(colour = \"black\", fill = \"grey\", aes(y = after_stat(density)), binwidth = 2) +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = c(mean = 100, sd = 15), linewidth = 1, color = \"red\", lty = 2) +\n  xlab(\"IQ\") +\n  ylab(\"number of people\") +\n  theme_bw(base_size = 20) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(x), colour = \"gray20\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(50, 150)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(50, 150, 10)) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = mean(x), y = 0.02, label = paste(\"Mean = \", round(mean(x)), \"\\n\", \"SD = \", round(sd(x)), sep = \"\"), size = 8) + \n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#fffafa\")) + \n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#fffafa\"))\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: Simulation of 10 random datapoints with mean = 100 and sd = 15 in the population.\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above provides one example of a randomly simulated dataset of 10 points drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The grey bars indicate the frequency with which each IQ score was observed. The red dotted line illustrates the normal distribution based on the mean and sd of the population. Both the observed mean (97; thin vertical dashed line), as well as the observed standard deviation (14), differ from the true population values. If we simulate 4 additional datasets, we see both the mean and the standard deviation vary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine we did not yet know what the mean IQ was in our population (where M = 100), or the standard deviation (where SD = 15), and that we would only have access to one dataset. Our estimate might be rather far off. This type of variation is to be expected in small samples of 10 participants, given the true standard deviation. The variability in the mean is determined by the standard deviation of the measurement. In real life, the standard deviation can be reduced by for example using multiple and reliable measurements (which is why an IQ test has not just one question, but many different questions). But we can also make sure our sample mean is closer to the population mean by increasing the sample size.\nA new simulated sample with 100 participants is plotted below. We are slowly seeing what is known as the normal distribution (and the frequency scores start to resemble the red dotted line illustrating the normal distribution of the population). This is the well-known bell shaped curve that represents the distribution of many variables in scientific research (although some other types of distributions are quite common as well). The mean and standard deviation are much closer to the true mean and standard deviation, and this is true for most of the simulated samples if you set n &lt;- 100 in the code above and run additional simulations.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: 100 random datapoints with mean = 100 and sd = 15 in the population.\n\n\n\n\nIf we simulate a really large sample of 1000 observations, we will see the benefits of collecting a large sample size in terms of accuracy of the measurement. Not every simulated study of 1000 people will yield the true mean and standard deviation, but it will happen quite often. And note how although the distribution is very close to a normal distribution, even with 1000 people it is not perfect.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: 1000 random datapoints with mean = 100 and sd = 15 in the population.\n\n\n\n\nSo far, we have simulated only a single group of observations, but it is also informative to examine the variation we will observe when we compare the means in two independent groups. Assume we have a new IQ training program that will increase people’s IQ score by 6 points. People in condition 1 are in the control condition – they do not get IQ training. People in condition 2 get IQ training. Let’s simulate 10 people in each group, assuming mean IQ in the control condition is 100 and in the experimental group is 106 (the SD is still 15 in each group).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: Simulation of 10 observations in two independent groups.\n\n\n\n\nThe two groups differ in how close they are to their true means, and as a consequence, the difference between groups varies as well. Note that this difference is the main variable in statistical analyses when comparing two groups in for example a t-test. In this specific simulation, we got quite extreme results, with a score of 96 (when the population mean is 100) and a score of 111 (when the population mean is 106). So in this sample, due to random variation, we calculate an effect size estimate that is quite a bit larger than the true effect size. Let’s simulate 4 additional datasets to see the variation.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: Four simulated samples of independent groups.\n\n\n\n\nWe see that there is quite some variation, up to the point that in one simulation the sample means are in the opposite direction of the population means. Again, increasing the sample size will mean that, in the long run, the sample means will get closer to the population means, and that we are more accurately estimating the difference between conditions. With 250 observations in each group, a randomly simulated set of observations for the two groups might look like Figure 11.6. Note that this difference might not look impressive. However, the difference would pass a significance test (an independent t-test) with a very low alpha level.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.6: Simulated sample of 250 independent observations.\n\n\n\n\nThe variation in the estimate of the mean decreases as the sample size increases. The larger the sample size, the more precise the estimate of the mean becomes. The standard deviation of the sample (\\(\\sigma_x\\)) of single IQ scores is 15, irrespective of the sample size, and the larger the sample size, the more accurately we can measure the true standard deviation. But the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean (\\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}\\)) decreases, as the sample size increases, and is referred to as the standard error (SE). The estimated standard deviation of the sample mean, or the standard error, calculated based on the observed standard deviation of the sample (\\(\\sigma_x\\)) is:\n\\[SE = \\sigma_{\\overline{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma_x}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] Based on this formula, and assuming an observed standard deviation of the sample of 15, the standard error of the mean is 4.74 for a sample size of 10, and 0.95 for a sample size of 250. Because estimates with a lower standard error are more precise, the effect size estimates in a meta-analysis are weighed based on the standard error, with the more precise estimates getting more weight.\nSo far we have seen random variation in means, but correlations will show similar variation as a function of the sample size. We will continue with our example of measuring IQ scores, but now we search for fraternal (so not identical) twins, and measure their IQ. Estimates from the literature suggest the true correlation of IQ scores between fraternal twins is around r = 0.55. We find 30 fraternal twins, measure their IQ scores, and plot the relation between the IQ of both individuals. In this simulation, we assume all twins have a mean IQ of 100 with a standard deviation of 15.\nThe correlation is calculated based on the IQ scores of one fraternal twin (x) and the IQ scores of the other fraternal twin (y) for each pair of twins, and the total number of pairs (N). In the numerator of the formula, the number of pairs is multiplied by the sum of the product of x and y, and from this value the sum of x multiplied by the sum of y is subtracted. In the denominator, the square root is taken from the number of pairs multiplied by the sum of x squared, from which the sum of x, which is then squared, is subtracted, and multiplied by the same calculation but now for y.\n\\[r=\\frac{n \\Sigma x y-(\\Sigma x )(\\Sigma y)}{\\sqrt{[n \\Sigma x^{2}-(\\Sigma x)^{2}][n \\Sigma y^{2}-(\\Sigma y)^{2}]}}\\] When we randomly simulate observations for 30 twins, we get the following result.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.7: Correlation based on 30 pairs.\n\n\n\n\nOn the x-axis, we see the IQ score of one twin, and on the y-axis we see the IQ score of the second twin, for each pair. The black dotted diagonal line illustrates the true correlation (0.55), while the yellow line shows the observed correlation (in this case, r = 0.43). The slope of the yellow line is determined by the observed correlation, but the position of the line is influenced by the mean IQ scores in both groups (in this simulation, the mean on the y-axis is 105, somewhat above 100, and the mean on the x-axis is 102, also slightly above 100. The blue area is the 95% confidence interval around the observed correlation. As we saw in the chapter on confidence intervals, 95% of the time (in the long run) the blue area will contain the true correlation (the dotted black line). As in the examples based on means, increasing the sample size to 300 narrows the confidence interval considerably, and will mean that most of the time the correlation in the sample is much closer to the correlation in the population. As the sample size increases, the estimate of the correlation becomes more precise, following the formula of the standard error of a correlation:\n\\[SE_{r_{xy}} = \\frac{1 - r^2_{xy}}{\\sqrt{(n - 2)}}\\]\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.8: Correlation based on 300 pairs.\n\n\n\n\nBecause estimates of means, standard deviations, or correlations based on small samples have relatively large uncertainty, it is preferable to collect larger samples. However, this is not always possible, and often the goal of a study is not to provide an accurate estimate, but to test a hypothesis. A study often requires less observations to achieve sufficient power for a hypothesis test, than are required to be able to accurately estimate a parameter (Maxwell et al., 2008). Therefore, scientists often rely on meta-analyses, where data from multiple studies are combined, to provide accurate estimates."

    "section": "\n11.2 A single study meta-analysis",
    "text": "11.2 A single study meta-analysis\nLet’s first begin with something you will hardly ever do in real life: a meta-analysis of a single study. This is a little silly, because a simple t-test or correlation will tell you the same thing – but it is educational to compare a t-test with a meta-analysis of a single study, before we look at how multiple studies are combined into a meta-analysis.\nA difference between an independent t-test and a meta-analysis is that a t-test is performed on the raw data, while a meta-analysis is typically performed on the effect size(s) of individual studies. The metafor R package contains a very useful function called escalc that can be used to calculate effect sizes, their variances, and confidence intervals around effect size estimates. So let’s start by calculating the effect size to enter into our meta-analysis. As explained in the chapter on effect sizes the two main effect sizes used for meta-analyses of continuous variables are the standardized mean difference (d) or the correlation (r), although it is of course also possible to perform meta-analyses on dichotomous variables (we will see an example below). The code below will calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) from two independent groups from means (specified by m1i and m2i), standard deviations (sd1i and sd2i), and the number of observations in each group (n1i and n2i). By default, metafor computes the effect size ‘Hedges’ g’ which is the unbiased version of Cohen’s d (see the section on Cohen’s d in the chapter on Effect Sizes).\n\nlibrary(metafor)\ng &lt;- escalc(measure = \"SMD\",\n            n1i = 50, # sample size in Group 1\n            m1i = 5.6, # observed mean in Group 1\n            sd1i = 1.2, # observed standard deviation in Group 1\n            n2i = 50, # sample size in Group 2\n            m2i = 4.9, # observed mean in Group 2\n            sd2i = 1.3) # observed standard deviation in Group 2\ng\n\n\n\n\nyi\nvi\n\n\n0.5552575\n0.0415416\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output gives you Hedge’s g (under the yi column, which always returns the effect size, in this case the standardized mean difference) and the variance of the effect size estimate (under vi). As explained in Borenstein (2009) formula 4.18 to 4.24 the standardized mean difference Hedges’ g is calculated by dividing the difference between means by the pooled standard deviation, multiplied by a correction factor, J:\n\\[\nJ = (1 - \\ \\ 3/(4df - 1))\n\\]\n\\[\ng = J \\times \\ \\left( \\frac{{\\overline{X}}_{1} - {\\overline{X}}_{2}}{S_{\\text{within}}} \\right)\n\\]\nand a very good approximation of the variance of Hedges’ g is provided by:\n\\[\nVg = J^{2} \\times \\left( \\frac{n_{1} + n_{2}}{n_{1}n_{2}} + \\frac{g^{2}}{2(n_{1} + n_{2})} \\right)\n\\]\nThe variance of the standardized mean difference depends only on the sample size (n1 and n2) and the value of the standardized mean difference itself. To perform the required calculations for a meta-analysis, you need the effect sizes and their variance. This means that if you have coded the effect sizes and the sample sizes (per group) from studies in the literature, you have the information you need to perform a meta-analysis. You do not need to manually calculate the effect size and its variance using the two formula above – the escalc function does this for you. We can now easily perform a single study meta-analysis using the rma function in the metafor package:\n\nmeta_res &lt;- rma(yi, vi, data = g)\nmeta_res\n\n\nRandom-Effects Model (k = 1; tau^2 estimator: REML)\n\ntau^2 (estimated amount of total heterogeneity): 0\ntau (square root of estimated tau^2 value):      0\nI^2 (total heterogeneity / total variability):   0.00%\nH^2 (total variability / sampling variability):  1.00\n\nTest for Heterogeneity:\nQ(df = 0) = 0.0000, p-val = 1.0000\n\nModel Results:\n\nestimate      se    zval    pval   ci.lb   ci.ub     \n  0.5553  0.2038  2.7243  0.0064  0.1558  0.9547  ** \n\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nUnder ‘Model Results’ we find the effect size Hedges’ g (0.56) and the standard error (0.2), the Z-test statistic testing the mean difference against the null-hypothesis (2.72), and the 95% confidence interval [ci.lb = 0.16; ci.ub = 0.95] around the effect size (the interval width can be specified using the ‘level =’ option). We also see the p-value for the test of the meta-analytic effect size against 0. In this case we can reject the null-hypothesis (p = 0.006).\nIn a meta-analysis, a Z-test is used to examine whether the null-hypothesis can be rejected. This assumes a normally distributed random effect size model. Normally, you would analyze data from a single study with two groups using a t-test, which not surprisingly uses a t-distribution. I don’t know why statistical computations sometimes care a lot about a small amount of bias (the difference between the effect size d and g, for example) and sometimes not (the difference between Z and t), but meta-analysts seem happy with Z-scores (in fact, with large enough sample sizes (which is commonly true in a meta-analysis) the difference between a Z-test and t-test is tiny). If we directly compare a single-study meta-analysis based on a Z-test with a t-test, we will see some tiny differences in the results.\nAs explained in the chapter on effect sizes we can directly calculate the effect size Hedges’ g (and it’s 95% confidence interval) using MOTE (Buchanan et al., 2017). The MOTE package uses the t-distribution when calculating confidence intervals around the effect size (and we can see this makes only a tiny difference compared to using the Z-distribution in a meta-analysis with 50 observations in each group).\nThe t-value is 2.835, and the p-value is 0.006. The results are very similar to those computed when performing a meta-analysis, with g = 0.55, 95% CI[0.16; 0.94], where the effect size and the upper bound for the confidence interval differ only 0.01 after rounding.\nIt is now common to visualize the results of a meta-analysis using a forest plot. According to Cooper et al. (2009) the first forest plot was published in 1978 (Freiman et al., 1978), with the goal to visualize a large set of studies that had concluded the absence of an effect based on non-significant results in small studies (see Figure 11.9). By plotting the width of the confidence interval for each study, it becomes possible to see that even though the studies do not reject an effect size of 0, and thus were all non-significant, many studies also did not reject the presence of a meaningful favorable treatment effect. To make large studies more noticeable in a forest plot, later versions added a square to indicate the estimated effect size, where the size of the square was proportional to the weight that will be assigned to the study when computing the combined effect.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.9: First version of a forest plot by Freiman and colleagues, 1978 (image from https://www.jameslindlibrary.org/freiman-ja-chalmers-tc-smith-h-kuebler-rr-1978/).\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 11.10 we see a modern version of a forest plot, with the effect size for Study 1 marked by the black square at 0.56, and the confidence interval visualized by lines extending to 0.16 on the left and 0.95 on the right. The numbers printed on the right-hand side of the forest plot provide the exact values for the effect size estimate and the lower and upper bound of the confidence interval. On the lower half of the forest plot, we see a stretched-out diamond, in a row labeled ‘RE Model’, for ‘Random Effects model’. The diamond summarizes the meta-analytic effect size estimate, being centered on that effect size estimate with the left and right endpoints at the 95% confidence interval of the estimate. Because we only have a single study, the meta-analytic effect size estimate is the same as the effect size estimate for our single study.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.10: Forest plot for a single study."

    "text": "11.3 Simulating meta-analyses of mean standardized differences\nMeta-analyses get a bit more exciting when we are using them to analyze results from multiple studies. When multiple studies are combined in a meta-analysis, effect size estimates are not simply averaged, but they are weighed by the precision of the effect size estimate, which is determined by standard error, which is in turn determined by the sample size of the study. Thus, the larger the sample size of an individual study, the more weight it gets in the meta-analysis, meaning that it has more influence on the meta-analytic effect size estimate.\nOne intuitive way to learn about meta-analyses is to simulate studies and meta-analyze them. The code below simulates 12 studies. There is a true effect in the simulated studies, as the difference in means in the population is 0.4 (and given the standard deviation of 1, Cohen’s d = 0.4 as well). The studies vary in their sample size between 30 observations and 100 observations per condition. The meta-analysis is performed, and a forest plot is created.\n\nset.seed(94)\nnSims &lt;- 12 # number of simulated studies\nm1 &lt;- 0.4 # population mean Group 1\nsd1 &lt;- 1 # standard deviation Group 1\nm2 &lt;- 0 # population mean Group 2\nsd2 &lt;- 1 # standard deviation Group 1\nmetadata &lt;- data.frame(yi = numeric(0), vi = numeric(0)) # create dataframe\n\nfor (i in 1:nSims) { # for each simulated study\n  n &lt;- sample(30:100, 1) # pick a sample size per group\n  x &lt;- rnorm(n = n, mean = m1, sd = sd1) \n  y &lt;- rnorm(n = n, mean = m2, sd = sd2)\n  metadata[i,1:2] &lt;- metafor::escalc(n1i = n, n2i = n, m1i = mean(x), \n       m2i = mean(y), sd1i = sd(x), sd2i = sd(y), measure = \"SMD\")\n}\nresult &lt;- metafor::rma(yi, vi, data = metadata, method = \"FE\")\npar(bg = \"#fffafa\")\nmetafor::forest(result)\n\n\n\nFigure 11.11: Forest plot for 12 simulated studies.\n\n\n\n\nWe see 12 rows, one for each study, each with their own effect size and confidence interval. If you look closely, you can see the squares that indicate the effect size estimate for each study differ in size. The larger the sample size, the bigger the square. Study 5 had a relatively small sample size, which can be seen by both the small square and the relatively wide confidence interval. Study 9 had a larger sample size, and thus a slightly larger square and narrower confidence interval. At the bottom of the graph we find the meta-analytic effect size and its confidence interval, both visualized by a diamond and numerically. The model is referred to as an FE Model, or Fixed Effect (FE) model. The alternative approach is an RE Model, or Random Effects (RE) model (the difference is discussed below).\nYou might notice that the first two studies in the meta-analysis were not statistically significant. Take a moment to think for yourself if you would have continued this research line, after not finding an effect twice in a row. If you feel like it, run the code above several times (remove the set.seed argued used to make the simulation reproducible first, or you will get the same result each time) and see how often this happens with a population effect size and range of sample sizes in this simulation. As should be clear from discussion of mixed results in the chapter on likelihoods, it is important to think meta-analytically. In the long run, there will be situations where you will find one or two non-significant results early in a research line, even when there is a true effect.\nLet’s also look at the statistical results of the meta-analysis, which is a bit more interesting now that we have 12 studies:\n\n\n\nFixed-Effects Model (k = 12)\n\nI^2 (total heterogeneity / total variability):   0.00%\nH^2 (total variability / sampling variability):  0.25\n\nTest for Heterogeneity:\nQ(df = 11) = 2.7368, p-val = 0.9938\n\nModel Results:\n\nestimate      se    zval    pval   ci.lb   ci.ub      \n  0.4038  0.0538  7.5015  &lt;.0001  0.2983  0.5093  *** \n\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nWe see a test for heterogeneity, a topic we will return to below. We see the model results, which in this specific simulation yielded a meta-analytic effect size estimate of 0.4. The confidence interval around the effect size estimate [0.3 ; 0.51] is much narrower than we saw before for a single study. This is because the 12 studies we simulated together have quite a large sample size, and the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error, and thus the narrower the confidence interval is. The meta-analytic effect size estimate is statistically different from 0 (p &lt; 0.0001) so we can reject the null hypothesis even if we use a stringent alpha level, such as 0.001. Note that, as discussed in the chapter on sample size justification and in line with the section on justifying error rates in the chapter on error control, it seems sensible to use a much lower alpha level than 5% in meta-analyses. It is possible to set the alpha level in metafor, e.g. using level = 0.999 (for an alpha level of 0.001), but this adjusts all confidence intervals, including those of the individual studies, which will mostly have used an alpha level of 0.05, so it is easier to just manually check if the test is significant at your chosen alpha level (e.g., 0.001)."

    "section": "\n11.4 Fixed Effect vs Random Effects",
    "text": "11.4 Fixed Effect vs Random Effects\nThere are two possible models when performing a meta-analysis. One model, known as a fixed effect model, assumes there is one effect size that generates the data in all studies in the meta-analysis. This model assumes there is no variation between individual studies – all have exactly the same true effect size. The author of the metafor package we used in this chapter prefers to use the term equal-effects model instead of fixed effect model. The perfect example of this is the simulations we have done so far. We specified a single true effect in the population, and generated random samples from this population effect.\nAlternatively, one can use a model where the true effect differs in some way in each individual study. We don’t have a single true effect in the population, but a range of randomly distributed true effect sizes (hence the ‘random effects’ model). Studies differs in some way from each other (or some sets of studies differ from other sets), and their true effect sizes differ as well. Note the difference between a fixed effect model, and a random effects model, in that the plural ‘effects’ is used only in the latter. Borenstein et al (2009) state there are two reasons to use a fixed effect model: When all studies are functionally equivalent, and when your goal is not to generalize to other populations. This makes the random effects model generally the better choice, although some people have raised the concern that random-effects models give more weight to smaller studies, which can be more biased. By default, metafor will use a random effects model. We used the method=\"FE\" command to explicitly ask for a fixed effect model. In the meta-analyses that we will simulate in the rest of this chapter, we will leave out this command and simulate random effects meta-analyses, as this is the better choice in many real life meta-analyses."

    "text": "11.5 Simulating meta-analyses for dichotomous outcomes\nAlthough meta-analyses on mean differences are very common, a meta-analysis can be performed on different effect sizes measures. To show a slightly less common example, let’s simulate a meta-analysis based on odds ratios. Sometimes the main outcome in an experiment is a dichotomous variable, such as the success or failure on a task. In such study designs we can calculate risk ratios, odds ratios, or risk differences as the effect size measure. Risk differences are sometimes judged easiest to interpret, but odds ratios are most often used for a meta-analysis because they have attractive statistical properties. An odds ratio is a ratio of two odds.

In the control condition, 23 people got a job, but 27 did not. The effect size estimate for the random effects model is 0.65. Feel free to play around with the script, adjusting the number of studies, or the sample sizes in each study, to examine the effect it has on the meta-analytic effect size estimate.\nWe can also get the meta-analytic test results by printing the test output. We see that there was no heterogeneity in this meta-analysis. This is true (we simulated identical studies), but is highly unlikely to ever happen in real life where variation in effect sizes between studies included in a meta-analysis is a much more realistic scenario.\n\n# Print result meta-analysis\nresult\n\n\nRandom-Effects Model (k = 12; tau^2 estimator: REML)\n\ntau^2 (estimated amount of total heterogeneity): 0 (SE = 0.0645)\ntau (square root of estimated tau^2 value):      0\nI^2 (total heterogeneity / total variability):   0.00%\nH^2 (total variability / sampling variability):  1.00\n\nTest for Heterogeneity:\nQ(df = 11) = 4.8886, p-val = 0.9364\n\nModel Results:\n\nestimate      se    zval    pval   ci.lb   ci.ub      \n  0.6548  0.1132  5.7824  &lt;.0001  0.4328  0.8767  *** \n\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1"

    "section": "\n11.6 Heterogeneity",
    "text": "11.6 Heterogeneity\nAlthough researchers often primarily use meta-analysis to compute a meta-analytic effect size estimate, and test whether this effect is statistically different from zero, an arguably much more important use of meta-analyses is to explain variation between (sets of) studies. This variation among (sets of) studies is referred to as heterogeneity. One goal of meta-analyses is not just to code effect sizes and estimate the meta-analytic effect size, but to code factors in studies that can explain heterogeneity, and examine which of these factors account for heterogeneity. This can help in theory evaluation or theory development. Tests have been developed to examine whether the studies included in a meta-analysis vary more than would be expected if the underlying true effect size in all studies was the same, and measures have been developed to quantify this variation.\nIf all studies have the same true population effect size, the only source of variation is random error. If there are real differences between (sets of) studies, there are two sources of variation, namely random variation from study to study and real differences in effect sizes in (sets of) studies.\nA classical measure of heterogeneity is Cochran’s \\(Q\\) statistic, which is the weighted sum of the squared differences between effect size estimates in each study, and the meta-analytic effect size estimate. The \\(Q\\) statistic can be used to test whether the absence of heterogeneity can be statistically rejected (by comparing it to the expected amount of variation, which is the degrees of freedom, df, or the number of studies -1, see Borenstein et al., 2009), but it can have low power if the number of studies in the meta-analysis is small (Huedo-Medina et al., 2006).\nOn theoretical grounds one might argue that some heterogeneity will always happen in a meta-analysis, and therefore it is more interesting to quantify the extent to which there is heterogeneity. The \\(I^2\\) index aims to quantify statistical heterogeneity. It is calculated as follows: \\[I^{2} = \\ \\frac{(Q - k - 1)}{Q} \\times 100\\%\\] where \\(k\\) is the number of studies (and \\(k-1\\) is the degrees of freedom). \\(I^2\\) ranges from 0 to 100 and can be interpreted as the percentage of the total variability in a set of effect sizes that is due to heterogeneity. When \\(I^2\\) = 0 all variability in the effect size estimates can be explained by within-study error, and when \\(I^2\\) = 50 half of the total variability can be explained by true heterogeneity. \\(I^2\\) values of 25%, 50%, and 75% can be interpreted as low, medium, and high heterogeneity. Finally, in a random effects meta-analysis, \\(\\tau^2\\) estimates the variance of the true effects, and \\(\\tau\\) is the estimated standard deviation, as expressed on the same scale as the effect size. A benefit of \\(\\tau^2\\) is that it does not depend on the precision, as \\(I^2\\) does, which tends to 100% if the studies included in the meta-analysis are very large (Rücker et al., 2008), but a downside is that \\(\\tau^2\\) is more difficult to interpret (Harrer et al., 2021).\nThe script below simulates a similar meta-analysis to the example for dichotomous outcomes above, but with a small variation. The first half of the simulated experiments are based on the population success rates 0.7 and 0.2, but the second half of the simulated experiments are based on the population success rates 0.9 and 0.7. Thus, in this set of studies the odds ratio differs for the first half of the studies, compared to the second half (successes in Group 1 and 2 are set to 0.2 and 0.7 for the first half, but to 0.7 and 0.9 in the second half). There is true heterogeneity. We use the confint function in the metafor package to report \\(I^2\\) and \\(\\tau^2\\), and their confidence intervals.\n\nlibrary(metafor)\nset.seed(2942)\nnSims &lt;- 12 # Number of simulated experiments\n\npr1 &lt;- 0.7 # Set percentage of successes in Group 1\npr2 &lt;- 0.2 # Set percentage of successes in Group 2\n\nai &lt;- numeric(nSims) # set up empty vector for successes Group 1\nbi &lt;- numeric(nSims) # set up empty vector for failures Group 1\nci &lt;- numeric(nSims) # set up empty vector for successes Group 2\ndi &lt;- numeric(nSims) # set up empty vector for failures Group 2\n\nfor (i in 1:nSims/2) { # for half (/2) of the simulated studies\n  n &lt;- sample(30:80, 1)\n  x &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, pr1) # produce simulated participants (1 = success, 0 = failure)\n  y &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, pr2) # produce simulated participants (1 = success, 0 = failure)\n  ai[i] &lt;- sum(x == 1) # Successes Group 1\n  bi[i] &lt;- sum(x == 0) # Failures Group 1\n  ci[i] &lt;- sum(y == 1) # Successes Group 2\n  di[i] &lt;- sum(y == 0) # Failures Group 2\n}\n\npr1 &lt;- 0.9 # Set percentage of successes in Group 1\npr2 &lt;- 0.7 # Set percentage of successes in Group 2\n\nfor (i in (nSims/2 + 1):(nSims)) { # for the other half (/2) of each simulated study\n  n &lt;- sample(30:80, 1)\n  x &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, pr1) # produce simulated participants (1 = success, 0 = failure)\n  y &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, pr2) # produce simulated participants (1 = success, 0 = failure)\n  ai[i] &lt;- sum(x == 1) # Successes Group 1\n  bi[i] &lt;- sum(x == 0) # Failures Group 1\n  ci[i] &lt;- sum(y == 1) # Successes Group 2\n  di[i] &lt;- sum(y == 0) # Failures Group 2\n}\n\n# Combine data into dataframe\nmetadata &lt;- cbind(ai, bi, ci, di)\n# Create escalc object from metadata dataframe \nmetadata &lt;- escalc(measure = \"OR\", \n                   ai = ai, bi = bi, ci = ci, di = di, \n                   data = metadata)\n# Perform Meta-analysis\nresult &lt;- rma(yi, vi, data = metadata)\n# Print result meta-analysis\nresult\nconfint(result) # Get confidence interval for indices of heterogeneity\n\n\nRandom-Effects Model (k = 12; tau^2 estimator: REML)\n\ntau^2 (estimated amount of total heterogeneity): 0.3174 (SE = 0.2429)\ntau (square root of estimated tau^2 value):      0.5634\nI^2 (total heterogeneity / total variability):   56.53%\nH^2 (total variability / sampling variability):  2.30\n\nTest for Heterogeneity:\nQ(df = 11) = 25.7650, p-val = 0.0070\n\nModel Results:\n\nestimate      se    zval    pval   ci.lb   ci.ub      \n  1.8125  0.2190  8.2764  &lt;.0001  1.3833  2.2417  *** \n\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n       estimate   ci.lb   ci.ub \ntau^2    0.3174  0.0355  1.2286 \ntau      0.5634  0.1883  1.1084 \nI^2(%)  56.5308 12.6888 83.4276 \nH^2      2.3005  1.1453  6.0341 \n\n\nBased on the test for heterogeneity, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. Tests for heterogeneity themselves have Type 1 and Type 2 error rates, and with a small number of studies (such as in our example, n = 12) tests for heterogeneity can have low power. If you remove the set.seed command and run the code multiple times, you will see that the test for heterogeneity will often not be significant, even though there is true heterogeneity in the simulation. In large meta-analyses, power can be so high that the test always yields a p-value small enough to reject the null hypothesis, but then it is important to look at the \\(I^2\\) estimate.\nRecently there has been considerable attention to the possibility that effect sizes within research lines have substantial heterogeneity (Bryan et al., 2021). Large heterogeneity can impact the power of studies, and therefore has consequences for how studies are planned (Kenny & Judd, 2019). Although heterogeneity seems to be low in direct replication studies (Olsson-Collentine et al., 2020) it is high in most meta-analyses, which has been argued to reflect a lack of understanding of the effects in those research lines (Linden & Hönekopp, 2021)."

    "section": "\n11.7 Strengths and weaknesses of meta-analysis",
    "text": "11.7 Strengths and weaknesses of meta-analysis\nThe conclusions from meta-analyses have been debated from the very first meta-analyses that were performed. It’s ironic that, as far as I can find, the ‘garbage in-garbage out’ criticism of meta-analysis originates from Eysenck (1978) because although it is valid criticism, Eysenck himself published literal garbage, as he was found guilty of scientific misconduct, which has led to a large number of retractions and expressions of concern. Eysenck wrote about a meta-analysis that yielded results he did not like:\n\nThe most surprising feature of Smith and Glass’s (1977) exercise in mega-silliness is their advocacy of low standards of judgment. More, they advocate and practice the abandonment of critical judgments of any kind. A mass of reports—good, bad, and indifferent—are fed into the computer in the hope that people will cease caring about the quality of the material on which the conclusions are based. If their abandonment of scholarship were to be taken seriously, a daunting but improbable likelihood, it would mark the beginning of a passage into the dark age of scientific psychology. The notion that one can distill scientific knowledge from a compilation of studies mostly of poor design, relying on subjective, unvalidated, and certainly unreliable clinical judgments, and dissimilar with respect to nearly all the vital parameters, dies hard. This article, it is to be hoped, is the final death rattle of such hopes. “Garbage in—garbage out” is a well-known axiom of computer specialists; it applies here with equal force.\n\nThe problem of ‘garbage in, garbage out’ remains one of the most common, and difficult to deal with, criticisms of meta-analysis. It is true that a meta-analysis cannot turn low quality data into a good effect size estimate, or highly heterogeneous effect sizes into a useful estimate of an effect size that generalizes to all studies included in the meta-analysis. The decision of which studies to include in a meta-analysis is a difficult one, and often leads to disagreements in the conclusions of meta-analyses performed on the same set of studies (Ferguson, 2014; Goodyear-Smith et al., 2012). Finally, meta-analyses can be biased, in the same way individual studies are biased, which is a topic explored in more detail in the chapter on bias detection.\nA strength of meta-analysis is that combining highly similar studies into a single analysis increases the statistical power of the test, as well as the accuracy of the effect size estimate. Whenever it is not possible, or it is efficient, to perform studies with a large number of observations in each study, an unbiased meta-analysis can provide better statistical inferences. Furthermore, including an internal meta-analysis in a multi-study paper (when all studies are sufficiently similar) can be a way to reduce the file-drawer problem, by allowing researchers to publish mixed results. At the same time, researchers have raised the concern that if researchers selectively report studies when they perform an internal meta-analysis they simply increase the flexibility in the data analysis, and are more likely to erroneously claim support for their hypothesis (Vosgerau et al., 2019). Researchers should publish all well-designed studies they have performed in a research line, and if the studies are similar and unbiased, a meta-analysis will improve inferences. At the same time, the result of a meta-analysis may be biased, and should not be interpreted as the final answer. For this reason, an analysis of the heterogeneity of effect size estimates, and the use of statistical techniques to detect bias, are an essential part of any meta-analysis."

    "text": "11.8 Which results should you report to be included in a future meta-analysis?\nIt would be a useful educational exercise for any researcher who publishes quantitative studies to code a dozen studies for a meta-analysis. A notorious problem when performing a meta-analysis is that researchers do not report all the results a meta-analyst needs in order to include the study in their meta-analysis. Sometimes the original researcher can be contacted and the missing information can be provided, but as every single study is just a data-point in a future meta-analysis, it is best to report all the required results to be included in a future meta-analysis.\nThe single best approach to guarantee that all required information for a future meta-analysis is available to meta-analysts is to share the (anonymized) data and analysis code with the manuscript. This will enable meta-analysts to compute any statistical information they need. Access to individual observations allows meta-analysts to perform analyses on subgroups, and makes it possible to perform more advanced statistical tests (Stewart & Tierney, 2002). Finally, access to the raw data, instead of only access to the summary statistics, makes it easier to find flawed individual studies that should not be included in a meta-analysis (Lawrence et al., 2021). As open data becomes the norm, efforts to standardize measures and develop specifications for datasets will facilitate the availability of raw data as input for meta-analyses. This will also facilitate the re-use of data, and allow researchers to perform meta-analyses unrelated to the main research question. If you want to share the raw data you will collect, make sure you address this in your informed consent form.\nWhen summarizing data in a scientific article, report the number of observations associated with each statistical test. Most articles will mention the total sample size, but if some observations are removed while cleaning the data, also report the final number of observations included in a test. When a statistical test is based on multiple conditions (e.g., a t-test), report the sample size in each independent group. If this information is missing, meta-analysts will often have to assume that the total number of observations is distributed equally across conditions, which is not always correct. Report full test results for significant and non-significant results (e.g., never write F &lt; 1, ns). Write out the full test result, including an effect size estimate, regardless of the p-value, as non-significant results are especially important to be included in meta-analyses. When reporting effect sizes, report how they were computed (e.g., when reporting standardized mean differences, did you compute Cohen’s d or Hedges’ g). Report exact p-values for each test, or the full test statistics that can be used to recompute the p-value. Report means and standard deviations for each group of observations, and for within-subject designs, report the correlation between dependent variables (which is currently almost always never reported, but is needed to compute Cohen’s \\(d_{av}\\) and perform simulation based power analyses based on the predicted data pattern). It might be useful to use a table to summarize all statistical tests if many tests are reported, but the raw data cannot be shared (for example in the supplemental material)."

    "text": "11.9 Improving the reproducibility of meta-analyses\nAlthough meta-analyses do not provide definitive conclusions, they are typically interpreted as state-of-the-art empirical knowledge about a specific effect or research area. Large-scale meta-analyses often accumulate a massive number of citations and influence future research and theory development. It is therefore essential that published meta-analyses are of the highest possible quality.\nAt the same time, the conclusions from meta-analyses are often open for debate and are subject to change as new data becomes available. We recently proposed practical recommendations to increase the reproducibility of meta-analyses to facilitate quality control, improve reporting guidelines, allow researchers to re-analyze meta-analyses based on alternative inclusion criteria, and future-proof meta-analyses by making sure the collected meta-analytic data is shared so that continuously accumulating meta-analyses can be performed, and so that novel statistical techniques can be applied on the collected data as they become available (Lakens et al., 2016). The need for the improvement in reproducibility of meta-analysis is clear - a recent review of 150 meta-analyses in Psychological Bulletin revealed that only 1 meta-analysis shared the statistical code (Polanin et al., 2020). This is unacceptable in the current day and age. In addition to inspecting how well your meta-analysis adheres to the JARS Quantitative Meta-Analysis Reporting Standards, following the recommendations summarized in Table 11.1 should substantially improve the state-of-the-art in meta-analyses.\n\n\n\n\nTable 11.1: Six practical recommendations to improve the quality and reproducibility of meta-analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat?\nHow?\n\n\n\nFacilitate cumulative science\nDisclose all meta-analytic data (effect sizes, sample sizes for each condition, test statistics and degrees of freedom, means, standard deviations, and correlations between dependent observations) for each data point. Quote relevant text from studies that describe the meta-analytic data to prevent confusion, such as when one effect size is selected from a large number of tests reported in a study. When analyzing subgroups, include quotes from the original study that underlie this classification, and specify any subjective decisions.\n\n\nFacilitate quality control\nSpecify which effect size calculations are used and which assumptions are made for missing data (e.g., assuming equal sample sizes in each condition, imputed values for unreported effect sizes), if necessary for each effect size extracted from the literature. Specify who extracted and coded the data, knowing it is preferable that two researchers independently extract effect sizes from the literature.\n\n\nUse reporting guidelines\nA minimal requirement when reporting meta-analyses is to adhere to one of the reporting standards (e.g., PRISMA). The reporting guidelines ask authors of meta-analyses to report essential information that should be made available either in the main text of the article, or by providing a completed checklist as supplementary material during review and after publication.\n\n\nPreregister\nWhenever possible, pre-register the meta-analysis research protocol (e.g., using PROSPERO) to distinguish between confirmatory and exploratory analyses. Perform a prospective meta-analysis where possible.\n\n\nFacilitate reproducibility\nAllow others to re-analyze the data to examine how sensitive the results are to subjective choices such as inclusion criteria. Always include a link to data files that can be directly analyzed with statistical software, either by providing completely reproducible scripts containing both the data and the reported analyses in free software (e.g., R), or at the very minimum a spreadsheet that contains all meta-analytic data that can easily analyzed in any statistical program.\n\n\nRecruit expertise\nConsider consulting a librarian before you start the literature search, and a statistician before coding the effect sizes, for advice on how to make the literature search and effect size calculations reproducible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor another open educational resource on meta-analysis in R, see Doing Meta-Analysis in R."

As the sample size increases, the standard deviation of the sample becomes more smaller, and the standard deviation of the mean (or standard error) becomes more accurate.As the sample size increases, the standard deviation of the sample becomes more accurate, and the standard deviation of the mean (or standard error) becomes more accurate. \n\n\nQ2: If we would perform a meta-analysis by just averaging all observed effect sizes, an effect size of d = 0.7 from a small study with 20 observations would influence the meta-analytic effect size estimate just as much as a d = 0.3 from a study with 2000 observations. How is the meta-analytic effect size estimate computed instead?\n\n\nEffect sizes estimates from small studies undergo a small study correction before being included.Effect size estimates from small studies are ignored when computing a meta-analytic effect size estimate.Effect sizes are weighed based on the precision of their estimate, determined by the standard error. Effect sizes are weighed based on how close they are to the meta-analytic effect size estimate, with studies further removed receiving less weight. \n\n\nQ3: The size of the squares indicating effect sizes in a forest plot vary as a function of the:\n\n\nPower of the studySize of the effectSample sizeType 1 error rate\n\n\nQ4: One can compute a ‘fixed effect model’ or a ‘random effects model’ when performing a meta-analysis on studies in the scientific literature. Which statement is true?\n\n\nIt is generally recommended to compute a fixed effect model, mainly because not all studies included in a meta-analysis will be functionally similar. It is generally recommended to compute a random effects model, mainly because not all studies included in a meta-analysis will be functionally similar.It is generally recommended to compute a fixed effect model, as this reduces the heterogeneity in the set of studies. It is generally recommended to compute a random effects model, as this reduces the heterogeneity in the set of studies. \n\n\nQ5: When there is no heterogeneity in the effect size estimates included in a meta-analysis, a fixed effect and random effects model will yield similar conclusions. If there is variability in the effect size estimates, the two models can yield different results. Below, we see two forest plots based on the same 5 simulated studies. The top plot is based on a random effects meta-analysis, the bottom plot based on a fixed effect meta-analysis. A random effects meta-analysis incorporates uncertainty about the variability of effect size estimates into the final meta-analytic estimate. How does this translate into a difference between the two plots?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.12: Simulated studies under a random effects model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.13: Simulated studies under a fixed effect model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no difference in the meta-analytic effect size estimate between the plots, as each effect size estimate from the 5 studies is identical. The effect size in the random effects model is identical to the estimate from the fixed effect model, but the confidence interval is larger. The effect size in the random effects model is identical to the estimate from the fixed effect model, but the confidence interval is smaller. The effect size in the random effects model is larger than the estimate from the fixed effect model, as it incorporates additional uncertainty about bias in the estimate. \n\n\nQ6: Which statement is true about the two measures of heterogeneity discussed above, Cochran’s \\(Q\\) and \\(I^2\\)?\n\n\nCochran’s \\(Q\\) relies on a hypothesis testing approach to detecting heterogeneity, and with few studies, it can have low power. \\(I^2\\) relies on an estimation approach, and with few studies, it can have large uncertainty.Cochran’s \\(Q\\) relies on an estimation approach, and with few studies, it can have large uncertainty. \\(I^2\\) relies on a hypothesis testing approach to detecting heterogeneity, and with few studies, it can have low power.\n\n\nQ7: Researchers who perform very similar studies in a research line can combine all studies (whether they all yield statistically significant results, or not) into an internal meta-analysis, combining the effect sizes into a meta-analytic estimate. What is a strength of this approach, and what is a risk?\n\n\nA strength is an internal meta-analysis can reduce the Type 1 error rate when multiple studies have been performed, each with their own 5% alpha level, but a weakness is that by selectively including studies in an internal meta-analysis, researcher have additional flexibility to p-hack.A strength is an internal meta-analysis can reduce the Type 1 error rate when multiple studies have been performed, each with their own 5% alpha level, but a weakness is that the effect size estimate might be biased compared to the estimates from the single studies, especially when there is heterogeneity.A strength is an internal meta-analysis can prevent publication bias by providing a way to report all results (including non-significant results), but a weakness is that by selectively including studies in an internal meta-analysis, researcher have additional flexibility to p-hack.A strength is an internal meta-analysis can prevent publication bias by providing a way to report all results (including non-significant results), but a weakness is that the effect size estimate might be biased compared to the estimates from the single studies, especially when there is heterogeneity.\n\n\nQ8: What is the best way to guarantee the statistical results in a meta-analysis are computationally reproducible?

    "section": "\n12.1 Publication bias",
    "text": "12.1 Publication bias\nPublication bias is one of the biggest challenges that science faces. Publication bias is the practice of selectively submitting and publishing scientific research, often based on whether or not the results are ‘statistically significant’ or not. The scientific literature is dominated by these statistically significant results. In 1959 Sterling (1959) counted how many hypothesis tests in 4 journals in psychology yielded significant results, and found that 286 out of 294 articles examined (i.e., 97%) rejected the null hypothesis with a statistically significant result. At the same time, we know that many studies researchers perform do not yield significant results. When scientists only have access to significant results, but not to all results, they are lacking a complete overview of the evidence for a hypothesis. In extreme cases, selective reporting can lead to a situation where there are hundreds of statistically significant results in the published literature, but no true effect because there are even more non-significant studies that are not shared. This is known as the file-drawer problem, when non-significant results are hidden away in file-drawers (or nowadays, folders on your computer) and not available to the scientific community. Every scientist should work towards solving publication bias, because it is extremely difficult to learn what is likely to be true as long as scientists do not share all their results, and because, as Greenwald (1975) notes, it is an ethical violation.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Screenshot of the final sentences of Greenwald, A. G. (1975). Consequences of prejudice against the null hypothesis. Psychological Bulletin, 82(1), 1–20.\n\n\n\n\nPublication bias can only be fixed by making all your research results available to fellow scientists, irrespective of the p-value of the main hypothesis test. Registered Reports are one way to combat publication bias, as this type of scientific article is reviewed based on the introduction, method, and statistical analysis plan, before the data is collected (Chambers & Tzavella, 2022; Nosek & Lakens, 2014). After peer review by experts in the field, who might suggest improvements to the design and analysis, the article can get an ‘in principle acceptance’, which means that as long as the research plan is followed, the article will be published, regardless of the results. This should facilitate the publication of null results, and as shown in Figure 12.4, an analysis of the first published Registered Reports in psychology revealed that 31 out of 71 (44%) articles observed positive results, compared to 146 out of 152 (96%) of comparable standard scientific articles published during the same time period (Scheel et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: Positive result rates for standard reports and Registered Reports. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals around the observed positive result rate.\n\n\n\n\nIn the past, Registered Reports did not exist, and scientists did not share all results (Franco et al., 2014; Greenwald, 1975; Sterling, 1959), and as a consequence, we have to try to detect the extent to which publication bias impacts our ability to accurately evaluate the literature. Meta-analyses should always carefully examine the impact of publication bias on the meta-analytic effect size estimate - even though only an estimated 57% of meta-analyses published in Psychological Bulletin between 1990 to 2017 report that they assessed publication bias (Polanin et al., 2020). In more recent meta-analyses published in educational research, 82% used bias detection tests, but the methods used were typically far from the state-of-the-art (Ropovik et al., 2021). Several techniques to detect publication bias have been developed, and this continues to be a very active field of research. All techniques are based on specific assumptions, which you should consider before applying a test (Carter et al., 2019). There is no silver bullet: None of these techniques can fix publication bias. None of them can tell you with certainty what the true meta-analytic effect size is corrected for publication bias. The best these methods can do is detect publication bias caused by specific mechanisms, under specific conditions. Publication bias can be detected, but it cannot be corrected.\nIn the chapter on likelihoods we saw how mixed results are to be expected, and can be strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis. It is not only the case that mixed results should be expected, but exclusively observing statistically significant results, especially when the statistical power is low, is very surprising. With the commonly used lower limit for statistical power of 80%, we can expect a non-significant result in one out of five studies when there is a true effect. Some researchers have pointed out that not finding mixed results can be very unlikely (or ‘too good to be true’) in a set of studies (Francis, 2014; Schimmack, 2012). We don’t have a very good feeling for what real patterns of studies look like, because we are continuously exposed to a scientific literature that does not reflect reality. Almost all multiple study papers in the scientific literature present only statistically significant results, even though this is unlikely.\nThe online Shiny app we used to compute binomial likelihoods displays, if you scroll to the bottom of the page, binomial probabilities to find multiple significant findings given a specific assumption about the power of the tests. Francis (2014) used these binomial likelihoods to calculate the test of excessive significance (Ioannidis & Trikalinos, 2007) for 44 articles published in the journal Psychological Science between 2009 and 2012 that contained four studies or more. He found that for 36 of these articles, the likelihood of observing four significant results, given the average power computed based on the observed effect sizes, was less than 10%. Given his choice of an alpha level of 0.10, this binomial probability is a hypothesis test, and allows the claims (at a 10% alpha level) that whenever the binomial probability of the number of statistically significant results is lower than 10%, the data is surprising, and we can reject the hypothesis that this is an unbiased set of studies. In other words, it is unlikely that this many significant results would be observed, suggesting that publication bias or other selection effects have played a role in these articles.\nOne of these 44 articles had been co-authored by myself (Jostmann et al., 2009). At this time, I knew little about statistical power and publication bias, and being accused of improper scientific conduct was stressful. And yet, the accusations were correct - we had selectively reported results, and selectively reported analyses that worked. Having received virtually no training on this topic, we educated ourselves, and uploaded an unpublished study to the website psychfiledrawer.org (which no longer exists) to share our filedrawer. Some years later, we assisted when Many Labs 3 included one of the studies we had published in the set of studies they were replicating (Ebersole et al., 2016), and when a null result was observed, we wrote “We have had to conclude that there is actually no reliable evidence for the effect” (Jostmann et al., 2016). I hope this educational materials prevents others from making a fool of themselves as we did."

    "text": "12.2 Bias detection in meta-analysis\nNew methods to detect publication bias are continuously developed, and old methods become outdated (even though you can still see them appear in meta-analyses). One outdated method is known as fail-safe N. The idea was to calculate the number of non-significant results one would need to have in file-drawers before an observed meta-analytic effect size estimate would no longer be statistically different from 0. It is no longer recommended, and Becker (2005) writes “Given the other approaches that now exist for dealing with publication bias, the failsafe N should be abandoned in favor of other, more informative analyses”. Currently, the only use fail-safe N has is as a tool to identify meta-analyses that are not state-of-the-art.\nBefore we can explain a second method (Trim-and-Fill), it’s useful to explain a common way to visualize meta-analyses, known as a funnel plot. In a funnel plot, the x-axis is used to plot the effect size of each study, and the y-axis is used to plot the ‘precision’ of each effect size (typically, the standard error of each effect size estimate). The larger the number of observations in a study, the more precise the effect size estimate, the smaller the standard error, and thus the higher up in the funnel plot the study will be. An infinitely precise study (with a standard error of 0) would be at the top of y-axis.\nThe script below simulates meta-analyses for nsims studies, and stores all the results needed to examine bias detection. In the first section of the script, statistically significant results in the desired direction are simulated, and in the second part null results are generated. The script generates a percentage of significant results as indicated by pub.bias - when set to 1, all results are significant. In the code below, pub.bias is set to 0.05. Because there is no true effect in the simulation (m1 and m2 are equal, so there is no difference between the groups), the only significant results that should be expected are the 5% false positives. Finally, the meta-analysis is performed, the results are printed, and a funnel plot is created.\n\nlibrary(metafor)\nlibrary(truncnorm)\n\nnsims &lt;- 100 # number of simulated experiments\npub.bias &lt;- 0.05 # set percentage of significant results in the literature\n\nm1 &lt;- 0 # too large effects will make non-significant results extremely rare\nsd1 &lt;- 1\nm2 &lt;- 0\nsd2 &lt;- 1\nmetadata.sig &lt;- data.frame(m1 = NA, m2 = NA, sd1 = NA, sd2 = NA, \n                           n1 = NA, n2 = NA, pvalues = NA, pcurve = NA)\nmetadata.nonsig &lt;- data.frame(m1 = NA, m2 = NA, sd1 = NA, sd2 = NA, \n                              n1 = NA, n2 = NA, pvalues = NA, pcurve = NA)\n\n# simulate significant effects in the expected direction\nif(pub.bias &gt; 0){\nfor (i in 1:nsims*pub.bias) { # for each simulated experiment\n  p &lt;- 1 # reset p to 1\n  n &lt;- round(truncnorm::rtruncnorm(1, 20, 1000, 100, 100)) # n based on truncated normal\n  while (p &gt; 0.025) { # continue simulating as along as p is not significant\n    x &lt;- rnorm(n = n, mean = m1, sd = sd1) \n    y &lt;- rnorm(n = n, mean = m2, sd = sd2) \n    p &lt;- t.test(x, y, alternative = \"greater\", var.equal = TRUE)$p.value\n  }\n  metadata.sig[i, 1] &lt;- mean(x)\n  metadata.sig[i, 2] &lt;- mean(y)\n  metadata.sig[i, 3] &lt;- sd(x)\n  metadata.sig[i, 4] &lt;- sd(y)\n  metadata.sig[i, 5] &lt;- n\n  metadata.sig[i, 6] &lt;- n\n  out &lt;- t.test(x, y, var.equal = TRUE)\n  metadata.sig[i, 7] &lt;- out$p.value\n  metadata.sig[i, 8] &lt;- paste0(\"t(\", out$parameter, \")=\", out$statistic)\n}}\n\n# simulate non-significant effects (two-sided)\nif(pub.bias &lt; 1){\nfor (i in 1:nsims*(1-pub.bias)) { # for each simulated experiment\n  p &lt;- 0 # reset p to 1\n  n &lt;- round(truncnorm::rtruncnorm(1, 20, 1000, 100, 100))\n  while (p &lt; 0.05) { # continue simulating as along as p is significant\n    x &lt;- rnorm(n = n, mean = m1, sd = sd1) # produce  simulated participants\n    y &lt;- rnorm(n = n, mean = m2, sd = sd2) # produce  simulated participants\n    p &lt;- t.test(x, y, var.equal = TRUE)$p.value\n  }\n  metadata.nonsig[i, 1] &lt;- mean(x)\n  metadata.nonsig[i, 2] &lt;- mean(y)\n  metadata.nonsig[i, 3] &lt;- sd(x)\n  metadata.nonsig[i, 4] &lt;- sd(y)\n  metadata.nonsig[i, 5] &lt;- n\n  metadata.nonsig[i, 6] &lt;- n\n  out &lt;- t.test(x, y, var.equal = TRUE)\n  metadata.nonsig[i, 7] &lt;- out$p.value\n  metadata.nonsig[i, 8] &lt;- paste0(\"t(\", out$parameter, \")=\", out$statistic)\n}}\n\n# Combine significant and non-significant effects\nmetadata &lt;- rbind(metadata.nonsig, metadata.sig)\n\n# Use escalc to compute effect sizes\nmetadata &lt;- escalc(n1i = n1, n2i = n2, m1i = m1, m2i = m2, sd1i = sd1, \n  sd2i = sd2, measure = \"SMD\", data = metadata[complete.cases(metadata),])\n# add se for PET-PEESE analysis\nmetadata$sei &lt;- sqrt(metadata$vi)\n\n#Perform meta-analysis\nresult &lt;- metafor::rma(yi, vi, data = metadata)\nresult\n\n# Print a Funnel Plot\nmetafor::funnel(result, level = 0.95, refline = 0)\nabline(v = result$b[1], lty = \"dashed\") # vertical line at meta-analytic ES\npoints(x = result$b[1], y = 0, cex = 1.5, pch = 17) # add point\n\nLet’s start by looking at what unbiased research looks like, by running the code, keeping pub.bias at 0.05, such that only 5% Type 1 errors enter the scientific literature.\n\n\n\nRandom-Effects Model (k = 100; tau^2 estimator: REML)\n\ntau^2 (estimated amount of total heterogeneity): 0.0000 (SE = 0.0018)\ntau (square root of estimated tau^2 value):      0.0006\nI^2 (total heterogeneity / total variability):   0.00%\nH^2 (total variability / sampling variability):  1.00\n\nTest for Heterogeneity:\nQ(df = 99) = 91.7310, p-val = 0.6851\n\nModel Results:\n\nestimate      se     zval    pval    ci.lb   ci.ub    \n -0.0021  0.0121  -0.1775  0.8591  -0.0258  0.0215    \n\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nWhen we examine the results of the meta-analysis we see there are 100 studies in the meta-analysis (k = 100), and there is no statistically significant heterogeneity (p = 0.69, which is not too surprising, as we programmed the simulation to have a true effect size of 0, and there is no heterogeneity in effect sizes). We also get the results for the meta-analysis. The meta-analytic estimate is d = -0.002, which is very close to 0 (as it should be, because the true effect size is indeed 0). The standard error around this estimate is 0.012. With 100 studies, we have a very accurate estimate of the true effect size. The Z-value for the test against d = 0 is -0.177, and the p-value for this test is 0.86. We cannot reject the hypothesis that the true effect size is 0. The CI around the effect size estimate (-0.026, 0.021) includes 0.\nIf we examine the funnel plot in Figure 12.5 we see each study represented as a dot. The larger the sample size, the higher up in the plot, and the smaller the sample size, the lower in the plot. The white pyramid represents the area within which a study is not statistically significant, because the observed effect size (x-axis) is not far enough removed from 0 such that the confidence interval around the observed effect size would exclude 0. The lower the standard error, the more narrow the confidence interval, and the smaller the effect sizes needs to be in order to be statistically significant. At the same time, the smaller the standard error, the closer the effect size will be to the true effect size, so the less likely we will see effects far away from 0. We should expect 95% of the effect size estimates to fall within the funnel, if it is centered on the true effect size. We see only a few studies (five, to be exact) fall outside the white pyramid on the right side of the plot. These are the 5% significant results that we programmed in the simulation. Note that all 5 of these studies are false positives, as there is no true effect. If there was a true effect (you can re-run the simulation and set d to 0.5 by changing m1 &lt;- 0 in the simulation to m1 &lt;- 0.5) the pyramid cloud of points would move to the right, and be centered on 0.5 instead of 0.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.5: Funnel plot of unbiased null results.\n\n\n\n\nWe can now compare the unbiased meta-analysis above with a biased meta-analysis. We can simulate a situation with extreme publication bias. Building on the estimate by Scheel et al. (2021), let’s assume 96% of the studies show positive results. We set pub.bias &lt;- 0.96 in the code. We keep both means at 0, so there still is not real effect, but we will end up with mainly Type 1 errors in the predicted direction in the final set of studies. After simulating biased results, we can perform the meta-analysis to see if the statistical inference based on the meta-analysis is misleading.\n\n\n\nRandom-Effects Model (k = 100; tau^2 estimator: REML)\n\ntau^2 (estimated amount of total heterogeneity): 0 (SE = 0.0019)\ntau (square root of estimated tau^2 value):      0\nI^2 (total heterogeneity / total variability):   0.00%\nH^2 (total variability / sampling variability):  1.00\n\nTest for Heterogeneity:\nQ(df = 99) = 77.6540, p-val = 0.9445\n\nModel Results:\n\nestimate      se     zval    pval   ci.lb   ci.ub      \n  0.2701  0.0125  21.6075  &lt;.0001  0.2456  0.2946  *** \n\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe biased nature of the set of studies we have analyzed becomes clear if we examine the funnel plot in fig-funnel2. The pattern is quite peculiar. We see four unbiased null results, as we programmed into the simulation, but the remainder of the 96 studies are statistically significant, even though the null is true. We see most studies fall just on the edge of the white pyramid. Because p-values are uniformly distributed under the null, the Type 1 errors we observe often have p-values in the range of 0.02 to 0.05, unlike what we would expect if there was a true effect. These just significant p-values fall just outside of the white pyramid. The larger the study, the smaller the effect size that is significant. The fact that the effect sizes do not vary around a single true effect size (e.g., d = 0 or d = 0.5), but rather effect sizes become smaller with larger sample sizes (or smaller standard errors), is a strong indicator of bias. The vertical dotted line and black triangle at the top of the plot illustrate the observed (upwardly biased) meta-analytic effect size estimate.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.6: Funnel plot of biased null results with mostly significant results.\n\n\n\n\nOne might wonder if such extreme bias ever really emerges in scientific research. It does. In Figure 12.7 we see a funnel plot by Carter & McCullough (2014) who examined bias in 198 published studies testing the ‘ego-depletion’ effect, the idea that self-control relies on a limited resource. Using bias detecting techniques such as PET-PEESE meta-regression they concluded based on the unbiased effect size estimated by PET (d = -0.1, which did not differ statistically from 0) that the true unbiased effect size might be d = 0, even though the meta-analytic effect size estimate without correcting for bias was d = 0.62. Do you notice any similarities to the extremely biased meta-analysis we simulated above? You might not be surprised that, even though before 2015 researchers thought there was a large and reliable literature demonstrating ego-depletion effects, a Registered Replication report yielded a non-significant effect size estimate (Hagger et al., 2016), and even when the original researchers tried to replicate their own work, they failed to observe a significant effect of ego-depletion (Vohs et al., 2021). Imagine the huge amount of wasted time, effort, and money on a literature that was completely based on bias in scientific research. Obviously, such research waste has ethical implications, and researchers need to take responsibility for preventing such waste in the future.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.7: Funnel plot from Carter and McCullough (2014) vizualizing bias in 198 published tests of the ego-depletion effect, including PET-PEESE bias-corrected effect size estimates.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also see signs of bias in the forest plot for a meta-analysis. In Figure 12.8, two forest plots are plotted side by side. The left forest plot is based on unbiased data, the right forest plot is based on biased data. The forest plots are a bit big with 100 studies, but we see that in the left forest plot, the effects randomly vary around 0 as they should. On the right, beyond the first four studies, all confidence intervals magically just exclude an effect of 0.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.8: Forest plot of unbiased meta-analysis (left) and biased meta-analysies (right).\n\n\n\n\nWhen there is publication bias because researchers only publish statistically significant results (p &lt; \\(\\alpha\\)), and you calculate the effect size in a meta-analysis, the meta-analytic effect size estimate is higher when there is publication bias (where researchers publish only effects with p &lt; \\(\\alpha\\)) compared to when there is no publication bias. This is because publication bias filters out the smaller (non-significant) effect sizes. which are then not included in the computation of the meta-analytic effect size. This leads to a meta-analytic effect size estimate that is larger than the true population effect size. With strong publication bias, we know the meta-analytic effect size is inflated, but we don’t know by how much. The true effect size could just be a bit smaller, but the true effect size could also be 0, such as in the case of the ego-depletion literature."

    "text": "12.3 Trim and Fill\nTrim and fill is a technique that aims to augment a dataset by adding hypothetical ‘missing’ studies (that may be in the ‘file-drawer’). The procedure starts by removing (‘trimming’) small studies that bias the meta-analytic effect size, then estimates the true effect size, and ends with ‘filling’ in a funnel plot with studies that are assumed to be missing due to publication bias. In the fig-trimfill1, you can see the same funnel plot as above, but now with added hypothetical studies (the unfilled circles which represent ‘imputed’ studies). If you look closely, you’ll see these points each have a mirror image on the opposite side of the meta-analytic effect size estimate (this is clearest in the lower half of the funnel plot). If we examine the result of the meta-analysis that includes these imputed studies, we see that trim and fill successfully alerts us to the fact that the meta-analysis is biased (if not, it would not add imputed studies) but it fails miserably in correcting the effect size estimate. In the funnel plot, we see the original (biased) effect size estimate indicated by the triangle, and the meta-analytic effect size estimate adjusted with the trim-and-fill method (indicated by the black circle). We see the meta-analytic effect size estimate is a bit lower, but given that the true effect size in the simulation was 0, the adjustment is clearly not sufficient.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.9: Funnel plot with assumed missing effects added through trim-and-fill.\n\n\n\n\nTrim-and-fill is not very good under many realistic publication bias scenarios. The method is criticized for its reliance on the strong assumption of symmetry in the funnel plot. When publication bias is based on the p-value of the study (arguably the most important source of publication bias in many fields) the trim-and-fill method does not perform well enough to yield a corrected meta-analytic effect size estimate that is close to the true effect size (Peters et al., 2007; Terrin et al., 2003). When the assumptions are met, it can be used as a sensitivity analysis. Researchers should not report the trim-and-fill corrected effect size estimate as a realistic estimate of the unbiased effect size. If other bias-detection tests (like p-curve or z-curve discussed below) have already indicated the presence of bias, the trim-and-fill procedure might not provide additional insights."

    "section": "\n12.4 PET-PEESE",
    "text": "12.4 PET-PEESE\nA novel class of solutions to publication bias is meta-regression. Instead of plotting a line through individual data-points, in meta-regression a line is plotted through data points that each represent a study. As with normal regression, the more data meta-regression is based on, the more precise the estimate is and, therefore, the more studies in a meta-analysis, the better meta-regression will work in practice. If the number of studies is small, all bias detection tests lose power, and this is something that one should keep in mind when using meta-regression. Furthermore, regression requires sufficient variation in the data, which in the case of meta-regression means a wide range of sample sizes (recommendations indicate meta-regression performs well if studies have a range from 15 to 200 participants in each group – which is not typical for most research areas in psychology). Meta-regression techniques try to estimate the population effect size if precision was perfect (so when the standard error = 0).\nOne meta-regression technique is known as PET-PEESE (Stanley et al., 2017; Stanley & Doucouliagos, 2014). It consists of a ‘precision-effect-test’ (PET) which can be used in a Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing framework to test whether the meta-regression estimate can reject an effect size of 0 based on the 95% CI around the PET estimate at the intercept SE = 0. Note that when the confidence interval is very wide due to a small number of observations, this test might have low power, and have an a-priori low probability of rejecting the null effect. The estimated effect size for PET is calculated with: \\(d = β_0 + β_1SE_i + _ui\\) where d is the estimated effect size, SE is the standard error, and the equation is estimated using weighted least squares (WLS), with 1/SE2i as the weights. The PET estimate underestimates the effect size when there is a true effect. Therefore, the PET-PEESE procedure recommends first using PET to test whether the null can be rejected, and if so, then the ‘precision-effect estimate with standard error’ (PEESE) should be used to estimate the meta-analytic effect size. In PEESE, the standard error (used in PET) is replaced by the variance (i.e., the standard error squared), which Stanley & Doucouliagos (2014) find reduces the bias of the estimated meta-regression intercept.\nPET-PEESE has limitations, as all bias detection techniques have. The biggest limitations are that it does not work well when there are few studies, all the studies in a meta-analysis have small sample sizes, or when there is large heterogeneity in the meta-analysis (Stanley et al., 2017). When these situations apply (and they will in practice), PET-PEESE might not be a good approach. Furthermore, there are some situations where there might be a correlation between sample size and precision, which in practice will often be linked to heterogeneity in the effect sizes included in a meta-analysis. For example, if true effects are different across studies, and people perform power analyses with accurate information about the expected true effect size, large effect sizes in a meta-analysis will have small sample sizes, and small effects will have large sample sizes. Meta-regression is, like normal regression, a way to test for an association, but you need to think about the causal mechanism behind the association.\nLet’s explore how PET-PEESE meta-regression attempts to give us an unbiased effect size estimate, under specific assumptions of how publication bias is caused. In fig-petpeese we once again see the funnel plot, now complemented with 2 additional lines through the plots. The vertical line at d = 0.27 is the meta-analytic effect size estimate, which is upwardly biased because we are averaging over statistically significant studies only. There are 2 additional lines, which are the meta-regression lines for PET-PEESE based on the formulas detailed previously. The straight diagonal line gives us the PET estimate at a SE of 0 (an infinite sample, at the top of the plot), indicated by the circle. The dotted line around this PET estimate is the 95% confidence interval for the estimate. In this case, the 95% CI contains 0, which means that based on the PET estimate of d = 0.02, we cannot reject a meta-analytic effect size of 0. Note that even with 100 studies, the 95% CI is quite wide. Meta-regression is, just like normal regression, only as accurate as the data we have. This is one limitation of PET-PEESE meta-regression: With small numbers of studies in the meta-analysis, it has low accuracy. If we had been able to reject the null based on the PET estimate, we would then have used the PEESE estimate (indicated by the diamond shape) of d = 0.17 for the meta-analytic effect size, corrected for bias (while never knowing whether the model underlying the PEESE estimate corresponded to the true bias generating mechanisms in the meta-analysis, and thus if the meta-analytic estimate was accurate).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.10: Funnel plot with PETPEESE regression lines."

    "section": "\n12.5 P-value meta-analysis",
    "text": "12.5 P-value meta-analysis\nIn addition to a meta-analysis of effect sizes, it is possible to perform a meta-analysis of p-values. The first of such approaches is known as the Fisher’s combined probability test, and more recent bias detection tests such as p-curve analysis (Simonsohn et al., 2014) and p-uniform* (Aert & Assen, 2018) build on this idea. These two techniques are an example of selection model approaches to test and adjust for meta-analysis (Iyengar & Greenhouse, 1988), where a model about the data generating process of the effect sizes is combined with a selection model of how publication bias impacts which effect sizes become part of the scientific literature. An example of a data generating process would be that results of studies are generated by statistical tests where all test assumptions are met, and the studies have some average power. A selection model might be that all studies are published, as long as they are statistically significant at an alpha level of 0.05.\nP-curve analysis uses exactly this selection model. It assumes all significant results are published, and examines whether the data generating process mirrors what would be expected if the studies have a certain power, or whether the data generating process mirrors the pattern expected if the null hypothesis is true. As discussed in the section on which p-values you can expect, for continuously distributed test statistics (e.g., t-values, F-values, Z-scores) we should observe uniformly distributed p-values when the null hypothesis is true, and more small significant p-values (e.g., 0.01) than large significant p-values (e.g., 0.04) when the alternative hypothesis is true. P-curve analysis performs two tests. In the first test, p-curve analysis examines whether the p-value distribution is flatter than what would be expected if the studies you analyze had 33% power. This value is somewhat arbitrary (and can be adjusted), but the idea is to reject at the smallest level of statistical power that would lead to useful insights about the presence of effects. If the average power in the set of studies is less than 33%, there might be an effect, but the studies are not designed well enough to learn about it by performing statistical tests. If we can reject the presence of a pattern of p-values that has at least 33% power, this suggests the distribution looks more like one expected when the null hypothesis is true. That is, we would doubt there is an effect in the set of studies included in the meta-analysis, even though all individual studies were statistically significant.\nThe second test examines whether the p-value distribution is sufficiently right-skewed (more small significant p-values than large significant p-values), such that the pattern suggests we can reject a uniform p-value distribution. If we can reject a uniform p-value distribution, this suggests the studies might have examined a true effect and had at least some power. If the second test is significant, we would act as if the set of studies examines some true effect, even though there might be publication bias. As an example, let’s consider Figure 3 from Simonsohn and colleagues (2014). The authors compared 20 papers in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that used a covariate in the analysis, and 20 studies that did not use a covariate. The authors suspected that researchers might add a covariate in their analyses to try to find a p-value smaller than 0.05, when the first analysis they tried did not yield a significant effect.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.11: Figure 3 from Simonsohn et al (2014) showing a p-curve with and without bias.\n\n\n\n\nThe p-curve distribution of the observed p-values is represented by five points in the blue line. P-curve analysis is performed only on statistically significant results, based on the assumption that these are always published, and thus that this part of the p-value distribution contains all studies that were performed. The 5 points illustrate the percentage of p-values between 0 and 0.01, 0.01 and 0.02, 0.02 and 0.03, 0.03 and 0.04, and 0.04 and 0.05. In the figure on the right, you see a relatively normal right-skewed p-value distribution, with more low than high p-values. The p-curve analysis shows that the blue line in the right figure is more right-skewed than the uniform red line (where the red line is the uniform p-value distribution expected if there was no effect). Simonsohn and colleagues summarize this pattern as an indication that the set of studies has ‘evidential value’, but this terminology is somewhat misleading. The formally correct interpretation is that we can reject a p-value distribution as expected when the null hypothesis was true in all studies included in the p-curve analysis. Rejecting a uniform p-value distribution does not automatically mean there is evidence for the theorized effect (e.g., the pattern could be caused by a mix of null effects and a small subset of studies that show an effect due to a methodological confound).\nIn the left figure we see the opposite pattern, with mainly high p-values around 0.05, and almost no p-values around 0.01. Because the blue line is significantly flatter than the green line, the p-curve analysis suggests this set of studies is the result of selection bias and was not generated by a set of sufficiently powered studies. P-curve analysis is a useful tool. But it is important to correctly interpret what a p-curve analysis can tell you. A right-skewed p-curve does not prove that there is no bias, or that the theoretical hypothesis is true. A flat p-curve does not prove that the theory is incorrect, but it does show that the studies that were meta-analyzed look more like the pattern that would be expected if the null hypothesis was true, and there was selection bias.\nThe script stores all the test statistics for the 100 simulated t-tests that are included in the meta-analysis. The first few rows look like:\n\n\nt(136)=0.208132209831132\nt(456)=-1.20115958535433\nt(58)=0.0422284763301259\nt(358)=0.0775200850900646\nt(188)=2.43353676652346\n\n\nPrint all test results with cat(metadata$pcurve, sep = \"\\n\"), and go to the online p-curve app at http://www.p-curve.com/app4/. Paste all the test results, and click the ‘Make the p-curve’ button. Note that the p-curve app will only yield a result when there are p-values smaller than 0.05 - if all test statistics yield a p &gt; 0.05, the p-curve cannot be computed, as these tests are ignored.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.12: Result of the p-curve analysis of the biased studies.\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of p-values clearly looks like it comes from a uniform distribution (as it indeed does), and the statistical test indicates we can reject a p-value distribution as steep or steeper as would be generated by a set of studies with 33% power, p &lt; 0.0001. The app also provides an estimate of the average power of the tests that generated the observed p-value distribution, 5%, which is indeed correct. Therefore, we can conclude these studies, even though many effects are statistically significant, are more in line with selective reporting of Type 1 errors, than with a p-value distribution that should be expected if there was a true effect that was studied with sufficient statistical power. The theory might still be true, but the set of studies we have analyzed here do not provide support for the theory.\nA similar meta-analytic technique is p-uniform*. This technique is similar to p-curve analysis and selection bias models, but it uses the results both from significant and non-significant studies, and can be used to estimate a bias-adjusted meta-analytic effect size estimate. The technique uses a random-effects model to estimate the effect sizes for each study, and weighs them based on a selection model that assumes significant results are more likely to be published than non-significant results. Below, we see the output of the p-uniform* which estimates the bias-corrected effect size to be d = 0.0126. This effect size is not statistically different from 0, p = 0.3857, and therefore this bias detection technique correctly indicates that even though all effects were statistically significant, the set of studies does not provide a good reason to reject a meta-analytic effect size estimate of 0.\n\npuniform::puniform(m1i = metadata$m1, m2i = metadata$m2, n1i = metadata$n1, \n  n2i = metadata$n2, sd1i = metadata$sd1, sd2i = metadata$sd2, side = \"right\")\n\n\nMethod: P\n\nEffect size estimation p-uniform\n\n       est     ci.lb     ci.ub       L.0      pval      ksig\n    0.0126   -0.0811    0.0887   -0.2904    0.3857        96\n\n===\n\nPublication bias test p-uniform\n\n      L.pb    pval\n    7.9976   &lt;.001\n\n===\n\nFixed-effect meta-analysis\n\n    est.fe     se.fe   zval.fe pval.fe  ci.lb.fe  ci.ub.fe     Qstat     Qpval\n    0.2701    0.0125   21.6025   &lt;.001    0.2456    0.2946   77.6031     0.945\n\n\nAn alternative technique that also meta-analyzes the p-values from individual studies is a z-curve analysis, which is a meta-analysis of observed power ((Bartoš & Schimmack, 2020; Brunner & Schimmack, 2020); for an example, see (Sotola, 2022)). Like a traditional meta-analysis, z-curve analysis transforms observed test results (p-values) into z-scores. In an unbiased literature where the null hypothesis is true, we should observe approximately \\(\\alpha\\)% significant results. If the null is true, the distribution of z-scores is centered on 0. Z-curve analysis computes absolute z-values, and therefore \\(\\alpha\\)% of z-scores should be larger than the critical value (1.96 for a 5% alpha level). In fig-zcurveunbiasednull z-scores for 1000 studies are plotted, with a true effect size of 0, where exactly 5% of the observed results are statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.13: Z-curve analysis for 1000 studies with a true effect size of 0 without publication bias.\n\n\n\n\nIf there is a true effect, the distribution of z-scores shifts away from 0, as a function of the statistical power of the test. The higher the power, the further to the right the distribution of z-scores will be located. For example, when examining an effect with 66% power, an unbiased distribution of z-scores, computed from observed p-values, looks like the distribution in fig-zcurveunbiasedalternative.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.14: Z-curve analysis for 1000 studies with a true effect size of d = 0.37 and n = 100 per condition in an independent t-test without publication bias.\n\n\n\n\nIn any meta-analysis the studies that are included will differ in their statistical power, and their true effect size (due to heterogeneity). Z-curve analysis uses mixtures of normal distributions centered at means 0 to 6 to fit a model of the underlying effect sizes that best represents the observed results in the included studies (for the technical details, see Bartoš & Schimmack (2020). The z-curve then aims to estimate the average power of the set of studies, and then calculates the observed discovery rate (ODR: the percentage of significant results, or the observed power), the expected discovery rate (EDR: the proportion of the area under the curve on the right side of the significance criterion) and the expected replication rate (ERR: the expected proportion of successfully replicated significant studies from all significant studies). The z-curve is able to correct for selection bias for positive results (under specific assumptions), and can estimate the EDR and ERR using only the significant p-values.\nTo examine the presence of bias, it is preferable to submit non-significant and significant p-values to a z-curve analysis, even if only the significant p-values are used to produce estimates. Publication bias can then be examined by comparing the ODR to the EDR. If the percentage of significant results in the set of studies (ODR) is much higher than the expected discovery rate (EDR), this is a sign of bias. If we analyze the same set of biased studies as we used to illustrate the bias detection techniques discussed above, z-curve analysis should be able to indicate the presence of bias. We can perform the z-curve with the following code:\n\nz_res &lt;- zcurve::zcurve(p = metadata$pvalues, method = \"EM\", bootstrap = 1000)\nsummary(z_res, all = TRUE)\nplot(z_res, annotation = TRUE, CI = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall:\nzcurve::zcurve(p = metadata$pvalues, method = \"EM\", bootstrap = 1000)\n\nmodel: EM via EM\n\n              Estimate  l.CI   u.CI\nERR              0.052 0.025  0.160\nEDR              0.053 0.050  0.119\nSoric FDR        0.947 0.389  1.000\nFile Drawer R   17.987 7.399 19.000\nExpected N        1823   806   1920\nMissing N         1723   706   1820\n\nModel converged in 38 + 205 iterations\nFitted using 96 p-values. 100 supplied, 96 significant (ODR = 0.96, 95% CI [0.89, 0.99]).\nQ = -6.69, 95% CI[-23.63, 11.25]\n\n\nWe see that the distribution of z-scores looks peculiar. Most expected z-scores between 0 and 1.96 are missing. 96 out of 100 studies were significant, which makes the observed discovery rate (ODR), or observed power (across all these studies with different sample sizes) 0.96, 95% CI[0.89; 0.99]. The expected discovery rate (EDR) is only 0.053, which differs statistically from the observed discovery rate, as indicated by the fact that the confidence interval of the EDR does not overlap with the ODR of 0.96. This means there is clear indication of selection bias based on the z-curve analysis. The expected replicability rate for these studies is only 0.052, which is in line with the expectation that we will only observe 5% Type 1 errors, as there was no true effect in this simulation. Thus, even though we only entered significant p-values, z-curve analysis correctly suggests that we should not expect these results to replicate at a higher frequency than the Type 1 error rate."

    "text": "12.6 Conclusion\nPublication bias is a big problem in science. It is present in almost all meta-analyses performed on the primary hypothesis test in scientific articles, because these articles are much more likely to be submitted and accepted for publication if the primary hypothesis test is statistically significant. Meta-analytic effect size estimates that are not adjusted for bias will almost always overestimate the true effect size, and bias-adjusted effect sizes might still be misleading. Having messed up the scientific literature through publication bias, there is no way for us to know whether we are computing accurate meta-analytic effect sizes estimates from the literature. Publication bias inflates the effect size estimate to an unknown extent, and there have already have been several cases where the true effect size turned out to be zero. The publication bias tests in this chapter might not provide certainty about the unbiased effect size, but they can function as a red flag to indicate when bias is present, and provide adjusted estimates that, if the underlying model of publication bias is correct, might well be closer to the truth.\nThere is a lot of activity in the literature on tests for publication bias. There are many different tests, and you need to carefully check the assumptions of each test before applying it. Most tests don’t work well when there is large heterogeneity, and heterogeneity is quite likely. A meta-analysis should always examine whether there is publication bias, preferably using multiple publication bias tests, and therefore it is useful to not just code effect sizes, but also code test statistics or p-values. None of the bias detection techniques discussed in this chapter will be a silver bullet, but they will be better than naively interpreting the uncorrected effect size estimate from the meta-analysis.\nFor another open educational resource on tests for publication bias, see Doing Meta-Analysis in R."

Which interpretation of the output is correct?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.16: Result of the p-curve analysis of the biased studies in Q2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the continuous Stouffer’s test for the full p-curve, we cannot reject a p-value distribution expected under \\(H_0\\), and we can reject a p-value distribution as expected if \\(H_1\\) is true and studies had 33% power.Based on the continuous Stouffer’s test for the full p-curve, we can conclude the observed p-value distribution is not skewed enough to be interpreted as the presence of a true effect size, therefore the theory used to deduce these studies is incorrect.Based on the continuous Stouffer’s test for the full p-curve, we can conclude the observed p-value distribution is skewed enough to be interpreted in line with a p-value distribution as expected if \\(H_1\\) is true and studies had 33% power.Based on the continuous Stouffer’s test for the full p-curve, we can conclude the observed p-value distribution is flatter than we would expect if the studies had 33% power, and therefore, we can conclude these studies are based on fabricated data.\n\n\nQ6: The true effect size in the studies simulated in Q2 is 0 - there is no true effect. Which statement about the z-curve analysis below is true?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.17: Result of the z-curve analysis of the biased studies in Q2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe expected discovery rate and the expected replicability rate are both statistically significant, and therefore we can expect the observed effects to successfully replicate in future studies.Despite the fact that the average observed power (the observed discovery rate) is 100%, z-curve correctly predicts the expected replicability rate (which is 5%, as only Type 1 errors will be statistically significant). Z-curve is not able to find an indication of bias, as the expected discovery rate and the expected replicability rate do not differ from each other statistically.Although the observed discovery rate is 1 (indicating an observed power of 100%) the confidence interval ranges from 0.66 to 1, which indicates that the studies could have a lower but more realistic power, and the fact that 100% of the results were significant could have happened by chance.\n\n\nQ7: We did not yet perform a trim and fill analysis, and given the analyses above (e.g., the z-curve analysis), which statement is true?\n\n\nThe trim-and-fill method would most likely not indicate any missing studies to 'fill'. The trim-and-fill method has known low power to detect bias, and would contradict the z-curve or p-curve analysis reported above. The trim-and-fill analysis would indicate bias, but so did the p-curve and z-curve analysis, and the adjusted effect size estimate by trim-and-fill does not adequately correct for bias, so the analysis would not add anything.The trim-and-fill method provides a reliable estimate of the true effect size, which is not provided by any of the other methods discussed so far, and therefore it should be reported alongside other bias detection tests.\n\n\nQ8: Publication bias is defined as the practice of selectively submitting and publishing scientific research. Throughout this chapter, we have focused on selectively submitting significant results. Can you think of a research line or a research question where researchers might prefer to selectively publish non-significant results?\n\n\n12.7.1 Open Questions\n\nWhat is the idea behind the GRIM test?\nWhat is the definition of ‘publication bias’?\nWhat is the file-drawer problem?\nIn a funnel plot, what is true for studies that fall inside the funnel (when it is centered on 0)?\nWhat is true for the trim-and-fill approach with respect to its ability to detect and correct effect size estimates?\nWhen using the PET-PEESE approach, what is important to consider when the meta-analysis has a small number of studies?\nWhat conclusions can we draw from the 2 tests that are reported in a p-curve analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\nAert, R.

    "section": "\n13.1 Preregistration of the Statistical Analysis Plan",
    "text": "13.1 Preregistration of the Statistical Analysis Plan\nIn the past, researchers have proposed solutions to prevent bias in the literature due to inflated Type 1 error rates as a result of selective reporting. For example, Bakan (1966) discussed the problematic aspects of choosing whether or not to perform a directional hypothesis test after looking at the data. If a researcher chooses to perform a directional hypothesis test only when the two-sided hypothesis test yields a p-value between 0.05 and 0.10 (i.e., when a test yields p = 0.08, the researcher decides after seeing the result that a one-sided test was also warranted, and reports the p-value as 0.04, one-sided) then in practice the Type 1 error rate is doubled (i.e., is 0.10 instead of 0.05). Bakan (p. 431) writes:\n\nHow should this be handled? Should there be some central registry in which one registers one’s decision to run a one- or two-tailed test before collecting the data? Should one, as one eminent psychologist once suggested to me, send oneself a letter so that the postmark would prove that one had pre-decided to run a one-tailed test?\n\nDe Groot (1969) already pointed out the importance to “work out in advance the investigative procedure (or experimental design) on paper to the fullest possible extent” which should include “a statement of the confirmation criteria, including formulation of null hypotheses, if any, choice of statistical test(s), significance level and resulting confirmation intervals” and “for each of the details mentioned, a brief note on their rationale, i.e., a justification of the investigator’s particular choices.”\nThe rise of the internet has made it possible to create online registries that allow researchers to specify their study design, the sample plan, and statistical analysis plan before the data is collected. A time-stamp, and sometimes even a dedicated Digital Object Identifier (DOI) transparently communicates to peers that the research question and analysis plan were specified before looking at the data. This is important, because you can’t test a hypothesis on the data that is used to generate it. If you come up with a hypothesis by looking at data, the hypothesis might be true, but nothing has been done to severely test the hypothesis yet. When exploring data, you can perform a hypothesis test, but you cannot test a hypothesis.\nIn some fields, such as medicine, it is now required to register certain studies, such as clinical trials. For example, the International Committee of Journal Editors writes:\n\nthe ICMJE requires, and recommends, that all medical journal editors require registration of clinical trials in a public trials registry at or before the time of first patient enrollment as a condition of consideration for publication.\n\nThe use of study registries has been promoted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1997. In these registries a description of the study and contact information was provided with the main goal to make it easier for the public to take part in clinical trials. From 2000 onwards registries have increasingly been used to prevent bias, and regulations have become increasingly strict in terms of reporting both the primary outcome of studies before data collection, as well as updating the registry with the results after data collection is complete, although these rules are not always followed (Goldacre et al., 2018).\nThe requirement to register the primary outcome of interest on ClinicalTrials.gov was correlated with a substantial drop in the number of studies that observed statistically significant results, which could indicate that removing flexibility in how data was analyzed prevented false positive results from being reported. Kaplan and Irvin (2015) analyzed the results of randomized controlled trials evaluating drugs or dietary supplements for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular disease. They observed how 17 of 30 studies (57%) published before the requirement to register studies on ClinicalTrials.gov yielded statistically significant results, while only 2 out of 25 (8%) studies published after 2000 observed statistically significant results. Of course, correlation is not causation, so we can not conclude there is a causal effect. But if you go to the doctor when you are sick, and the doctor tells you that luckily there are two cures, one proven effective in a study published in 1996, and one from a study published in 2004, which cure would you pick?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2: Figure from Kaplan and Irvin (2015) showing the substantial drop in statistically significant results after the registration of primary outcomes was required on ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\n\n\n\nWhen implemented perfectly, study registries allow the scientific community to know about the planned analyses before data collection, and the main result of the planned hypotheses. However, these results might not necessarily end up in the published literature, and this is especially a risk for studies where predictions are not confirmed. One step beyond study registration is a novel publication format known as Registered Reports. Journals that publish Registered evaluate studies based on the introduction, method, and statistical analyses, but not on the results (Chambers & Tzavella, 2022; Nosek & Lakens, 2014). The idea to review studies before data collection is not new, and has proposed repeatedly during the last half century (Wiseman et al., 2019). As discussed in the section on publication bias, Registered Reports have a substantially larger probability of reporting findings that do not support the hypotheses compared to the traditional scientific literature (Scheel, Schijen, et al., 2021).\nThe benefits and downsides of publishing research as a Registered Report are still being examined, but one benefit is that researchers get feedback from expert reviewers at a time where they can still improve the study, instead of after data has already been collected. Moving the process of criticism on a study from after the study has been performed (as in traditional peer review) to before the study has been performed (through Registered Reports, or by implementing ‘Red Teams’ Lakens (2020) or methodological review boards Lakens (2023) at universities) is an idea worth exploring, and could make the process of scientific criticism more collaborative, as reviewers can help to improve a study, instead of deciding whether or not any flaws in a manuscript are too consequential to recommend publication."

    "text": "13.2 The value of preregistration\nPreregistration has the primary goal to allow others to transparently evaluate the capacity of a test to falsify a prediction, or how severely a hypothesis has been tested (Lakens, 2019). The severity of a test is determined by how likely a prediction is proven wrong when it is wrong, and proven right when it is right. During the research process researchers can make decisions that increase the probability their prediction will be statistically supported, even when it is wrong. For example, when Daryl Bem decided which of the 5 sets of stimuli to focus on in his results section, the choice to only focus on erotic stimuli (versus the mean of all stimuli, or the stimuli in another condition, such as negative pictures) was only justified by the fact that the p-value ended up being statistically significant. The opposite can also happen, where researchers desire to obtain a non-significant test result, and where researchers make decisions that lead to a higher likelihood of not corroborating a prediction (e.g., by reducing the statistical power), even if the prediction was correct. The goal of preregistration is to prevent researchers from non-transparently reducing the capacity of the test to falsify a prediction by allowing readers of their work to see how they planned to test their prediction before they had access to the data, and evaluate whether any changes from their original plan reduce how severely they tested their prediction.\nPreregistration adds value for people who, based on their philosophy of science, increase their trust in claims that are supported by severe tests and predictive successes. Preregistration itself does not make a study better or worse compared to a non-preregistered study (Lakens, 2019). Instead, it merely allows researchers to transparently evaluate the severity of a test. The severity of a test is in theory unrelated to whether a study is preregistered. However, in practice, whenever reward structures in science introduce researcher bias, preregistration is likely to increase the severity of tests. Preregistration would not add value when the correct analysis approach was completely clear to researchers and their readers, for example because the theory is so well specified that there is only on rational analysis plan. In most scientific fields, however, theories rarely completely constrain the test of predictions. Despite this, is important to recognize that there are cases where deviating from a preregistered analysis plan will lead to a more severely tested hypothesis. For example, if your preregistration failed to consider that some participants would be too drunk to respond meaningfully on your task, or when you forgot to specify what you would do if data was not normally distributed, then changing the original analysis plan would be seen by most fellow researchers as a more severe test, and not as a way to increase the probability you would find a statistically significant effect. If you transparently list all deviations from your analysis plan, and provide strong justifications for these deviations, the readers can draw their own conclusions about how severely a hypothesis has been tested.\nPreregistration is a tool, and researchers who use it should do so because they have a goal that preregistration facilitates. If the use of a tool is detached from a philosophy of science it risks becoming a heuristic. Researchers should not choose to preregister because it has become a new norm, but they should preregister because they can justify based on their philosophy of science how preregistration supports their goals. There are many types of research for which preregistration is not necessary. Although it is always good to be as transparent as possible when doing research, from a philosophy of science perspective, the unique value of preregistration is limited to research which aims to severely test predictions. Outside of this type of research, transparency (for example by sharing data, materials, and a lab notebook detailing decisions that were made) can be valuable to allow researchers to evaluate results in more detail. In addition to the primary goal of preregistration to allow others to evaluate how severely a prediction has been tested, researchers have reported secondary benefits of preregistering, such as feeling the preregistration improved their experimental design, analysis plan, and theoretical predictions (Sarafoglou et al., 2022). Although it is not necessary to publicly preregister to reap these benefits, a public preregistration can motivate researchers to more carefully think about their study in advance."

    "text": "13.3 How to preregister\nThe more detail a preregistration document has, the easier it is for others to transparently evaluate the severity of the tests that are performed. Because it is difficult to come up with all aspects that one should include, researchers have created websites to guide researchers through this process (e.g., https://aspredicted.org/), including submission guidelines, and templates (van ’t Veer & Giner-Sorolla, 2016). The template by Van ’t Veer and Giner-Sorolla is an excellent start, and is intended as a place to begin for people who have no experience preregistering their research. Another useful paper by Wicherts et al. (2016) provides a checklist of aspects to consider when planning, executing, analyzing, and reporting research.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.3: Screenshot of Table 1 in Wicherts et al., 2016, which depicts the checklist for preregistrations.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough these checklists were useful to introduce scientists to the idea of preregistration, it is important to raise the bar to the level we need to have high quality preregistrations that actually fulfill their goal to allow peer to evaluate the severity of a test. The first step towards this is for authors to follow reporting guidelines in their field. In psychology, this means following the Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS) (Appelbaum et al., 2018). The reporting guidelines encompass more suggestions than needed for a preregistration document, but I would recommend using JARS both for your preregistration document and when writing up the final report, as it is a very well-thought through set of recommendations. Taking JARS into account when planning or reporting your research is likely to improve your research.\nThe Journal Article Reporting Standards inform you about information that needs to be present on the title page, the abstract of your paper, the introduction, the method section, the results section, and the discussion. For example, JARS states that you should add an Author Note on the title page that includes “Registration information if the study has been registered”. The method and result sections receive a lot of attention in JARS, and these two sections also deserve a lot of attention in a preregistration. Remember that a severe test has a high probability of finding a predicted effect if the prediction is correct, and a high probability of not finding a predicted effect if the prediction is incorrect. Practices that inflate the Type 1 error rate increase the possibility of finding a predicted effect if a prediction is actually wrong. Low power, unreliable measures, a flawed procedure, or a bad design increase the possibility of not finding an effect when the prediction was actually correct. Incorrect analyses risk answering a question that is unrelated to the prediction researchers set out to test (sometimes referred to as a Type 3 error). As we see, JARS aims to address these threats to the severity of a test by asking authors to provide detailed information in their methods and results sections."

    "text": "13.4 Journal Article Reporting Standards\nAlthough in the following I will focus on quantitative experimental studies with random assignment to conditions (you can download the JARS table here), JARS includes tables for experiments without randomization, clinical trials, longitudinal designs, meta-analyses, and replication studies. The following items in the JARS table are relevant for a preregistration:\n\nDescribe the unit of randomization and the procedure used to generate the random assignment sequence, including details of any restriction (e.g., blocking, stratification).\nReport inclusion and exclusion criteria, including any restrictions based on demographic characteristics.\n\nThis prevents flexibility concerning the participants that will be included in the final analysis.\n\n\nDescribe procedures for selecting participants, including\n\nSampling method if a systematic sampling plan was implemented\nPercentage of the sample approached that actually participated\n\n\n\nYou might often not know what percentage of the sample you approach will participate, and getting this information might require some pilot data, as you might not be able to reach the desired final sample size (see below) with the sampling plan.\n\n\nDescribe the sample size, power, and precision, including\n\nIntended sample size\n\nDetermination of sample size, including\n\nPower analysis, or methods used to determine precision of parameter estimates\nExplanation of any interim analyses and stopping rules employed\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly stating the intended sample size prevents practices such as optional stopping, which inflate the Type 1 error rate. Be aware (or if not, JARS will remind you) that you might end up with an achieved sample size that differs from the intended sample size, and consider possible reasons why you might not manage to collect the intended sample size. A sample size needs to be justified, as do the assumptions in a power analysis (e.g., is the expected effect size realistic, or is the smallest effect size of interest indeed of interest to others?). If you used sequential analyses, specify how you controlled the Type 1 error rate while analyzing the data repeatedly as it came in.\nBecause there is a range of possible sample size justifications, I recommend using the online Shiny app that accompanies the sample size justification chapter. The Shiny app can be found here. The Shiny app guides you through four steps.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, researchers should specify the population they are sampling from. To describe the sample, researchers can simply follow the JARS guidelines, such as the Quantitative Design Reporting Standards:\n\nReport major demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status) and important topic-specific characteristics (e.g., achievement level in studies of educational interventions). In the case of animal research, report the genus, species, and strain number or other specific identification, such as the name and location of the supplier and the stock designation. Give the number of animals and the animals’ sex, age, weight, physiological condition, genetic modification status, genotype, health-immune status, drug or test naivete, and previous procedures to which the animal may have been subjected. Report inclusion and exclusion criteria, including any restrictions based on demographic characteristics.\n\nResearchers should also indicate if they can collect data from the entire sample (in which case the sample size justification is completed), and if not, which resource limitations they have (e.g., the time and money they have available for data collection).\nIn the second step, researchers should consider which effects of interest they can specify. Ideally, they are able to determine a smallest effect size of interest, but other approaches can also be used. In the third step researchers specify an inferential goal such as test a hypothesis, or measure an effect with accuracy. Finally, researchers should specify the total sample size (based on the number of participants and the number of observations per participant) and explain the informational value of the study (e.g., why is the sample size large enough to yield an informative answer to the research question?). After filling out the relevant fields in the Shiny app, researchers can download a PDF file that contains a complete sample size justification.\n\n\nDescribe planned data diagnostics, including\n\nCriteria for post-data collection exclusion of participants, if any\nCriteria for deciding when to infer missing data and methods used for imputation of missing data\nDefining and processing of statistical outliers\nAnalyses of data distributions\nData transformations to be used, if any\n\n\n\nAfter collecting the data, the first step is to examine the data quality, and test assumptions for the planned analytic methods. It is common to exclude data from participants who did not follow instructions, and these decision procedures should be prespecified. At each preregistration you will discover additional unforeseen consequences that will be added to these sections. If data is missing, you might not want to remove a participant entirely, but use a method to impute missing data. Because outliers can have an undue influence on the results, you might want to preregister ways to mitigate the impact of outliers. For practical recommendations on how to classify, detect, and manage outliers, see (Leys et al., 2019). If you are planning to perform statistical tests that have assumptions (e.g., the assumption of normality for Welch’s t-test) you need to preregister how you will decide whether these assumptions are met, and if not, what you will do.\n\n\nDescribe the analytic strategy for inferential statistics and protection against experiment-wise error for\n\nPrimary hypotheses\nSecondary hypotheses\nExploratory hypotheses\n\n\n\nThe difference between these three levels of hypotheses is not adequately explained in the JARS material, but Cooper (2020) explains the distinction a bit more, although it remains quite vague. The way I would distinguish these three categories is as follows. First, a study is designed to answer a primary hypothesis. The Type 1 and Type 2 error rates for this primary hypothesis are as low as the researcher can afford to make them. Secondary hypotheses are questions that a researcher considers interesting when planning the study, but that are not the main goal of the study. Secondary hypotheses might concern additional variables that are collected, or even sub-group analyses that are deemed interesting from the outset. For these hypotheses, the Type 1 error rate is still controlled at a level the researchers consider justifiable. However, the Type 2 error rate is not controlled for secondary analyses. The effect that is expected on additional variables might be much smaller than the effect for the primary hypothesis, or analyses on subgroups will have smaller sample sizes. Therefore, the study will yield an informative answer if a significant effect is observed, but a non-significant effect can not be interpreted because the study lacked power (both to reject the null hypothesis, are for an equivalence test). By labeling a question as a secondary hypothesis, a researcher specifies in advance that non-significant effects will not lead to clear conclusions.\nFinally, there is a left-over category of analyses that are performed in an article. I would refer to this category as exploratory results, not exploratory hypotheses, because a researcher might not have hypothesized these analyses at all, but comes up with these tests during data analysis. JARS requires researchers to report such results ‘in terms of both substantive findings and error rates that may be uncontrolled’. An exploratory result might be deemed impressive by readers, or not, depending on their prior belief, but it has not been severely tested. All findings need to be independently replicated if we want to be able to build on them - but all else equal, this requirement is more imminent for exploratory results."

    "text": "13.5 What Does a Formalized Analytic Strategy Look Like?\nA hypothesis test is a methodological procedure to evaluate a prediction that can be described on a conceptual level (e.g., “Learning how to preregister improves your research”), an operationalized level (e.g., “Researchers who have read this text will control their alpha level more carefully, and they will more precisely specify what would corroborate or falsify their prediction in a preregistration document”), and a statistical level (e.g., “An independent t-test comparing coded preregistration documents written by people who read this text will show a statistically lower number of ways in which the hypothesis could be tested, which implies more careful Type 1 error control, compared to people who did not read this text”). In a preregistration document, the goal should be to specify the hypothesis in detail at the statistical level. Furthermore, each statistical hypothesis should be clearly linked to the conceptual and operationalized level. In some studies people perform multiple tests, and it is often not clear which pattern of results would falsify the researchers’ predictions. Currently, preregistrations differ widely in how detailed they are, and not all preregistration have sufficient detail to treat them as confirmatory tests of predictions (Waldron & Allen, 2022).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.4: Different study types plotted on a dimension from fully exploratory to fully confirmatory (from Waldron & Allen, 2022).\n\n\n\n\nPreregistration is a relatively new practice for most researchers. It should not be surprising that there is often quite some room for improvement in the way researchers preregister. It is not sufficient to preregister - the goal is to preregister well enough so that others can evaluate the severity with which you tested your hypothesis. How do we do this? First, it is important to acknowledge that it is difficult to describe a hypothesis verbally. Just like we use notation to describe statistics because it removes ambiguity, verbal descriptions of hypotheses rarely sufficiently constrain potential flexibility in the data analysis.\nFor example, in the verbal description of a statistical hypothesis in the previous paragraph (which read “An independent t-test comparing coded preregistration documents written by people who read this text will show a statistically lower number of ways in which the hypothesis could be tested, which implies more careful Type 1 error control, compared to people who did not read this text”) it is not clear what alpha level I plan to use for the t-test, or whether I will perform Student’s t-test or Welch’s t-test. Researchers often implicitly treat a p &gt; 0.05 as falsifying a prediction, but this is a common misconception of p-values, and a hypothesis is often better falsified using a statistical test that can reject the presence of predicted outcomes, such as an equivalence test. Specifying explicitly how you will evaluate a hypothesis makes it clear how your prediction will be proven wrong.\nIn Lakens & DeBruine (2020) we discuss how a good way to remove ambiguity in a hypothesis test described in a preregistration document is to make sure it is machine readable. Machines are notoriously bad at dealing with ambiguous descriptions, so if the hypothesis is understandable for a machine, it will be clearly specified. A hypothesis is tested in an analysis that takes data as input and returns test results. Some of these test results will be compared to criteria, used in the evaluation of the test result. For example, imagine a hypothesis predicts that the mean in one group will be higher than the mean in another group. The data is analyzed with Welch’s t-test, and if the resulting p-value is smaller than a specified criterion alpha (e.g., 0.01) the prediction is evaluated as being corroborated. Our prediction is falsified if we can reject effects deemed large enough to matter in an equivalence test, and the result is inconclusive otherwise. In a clear preregistration of a hypothesis test, all these components (the analysis, the way results will be compared to criteria, and how results will be evaluated in terms of corroborating of falsifying a prediction) will be clearly specified.\nThe most transparent way to specify the statistical hypothesis is in analysis code. The gold standard for a preregistration is to create a simulated dataset that looks like the data you plan to collect, and write an analysis script that can be run on the dataset you plan to collect. Simulating data might sound difficult, but there are great packages for this in R, and an increasing number of tutorials. Since you will need to perform the analyses anyway, doing so before you collect the data helps you to carefully think through your experiment. By preregistering the analysis code, you make sure all steps in the data analysis are clear, including assumption checks, exclusion of outliers, and the exact analysis you plan to run (including any parameters that need to be specified for the test).\nIn addition to sharing the analysis code, you will need to specify how you will evaluate the test result when the analysis code is run on the data you will collect. This is often not made explicit in preregistrations, but it is an essential part of a hypothesis test, especially when there are multiple primary hypotheses, such as in our prediction that “Researchers who have read this text will become better at controlling their alpha level and more clearly specify what would corroborate or falsify their prediction”. If our hypothesis really predicts that both of these outcomes should occur, then the evaluation of our hypothesis should specify that the prediction is falsified if only one of these two effects occurs."

    "text": "13.6 Are you ready to preregister a hypothesis test?\nIt should often happen that the theory you use to make predictions is not strong enough to lead to falsifiable hypotheses. Especially early in research lines there are too many uncertainties about which analyses we will run, or which effects would be too small to matter. At these stages in the research process, it is more common to have a cyclical approach where researchers do an experiment to see what happens, use the insights to reformulate their theory, and design another experiment. The philosopher of science Van Fraassen summarizes this in his statement: “experimentation is the continuation of theory construction by other means.” During this process, we often need to examine whether certain assumption we make hold. This often requires tests of auxiliary hypotheses concerning the measures and manipulations we use (Uygun Tunç & Tunç, 2022).\nAs you prepare a preregistration document, you might be faced with many uncertainties that you don’t exactly know how to address. It might be that this is a sign that you are not yet ready to preregister a prediction. When testing hypotheses, corroborating a prediction should be impressive, and falsifying a prediction should be consequential for the theory you are testing. If you make arbitrary choices as you write down your predictions, the test might be neither impressive nor consequential. Sometimes you just want to collect data to describe, examine the relationship between variables, or explore boundary conditions, without testing anything. If that’s the case, don’t feel forced into a hypothesis testing straight-jacket (Scheel, Tiokhin, et al., 2021). Of course, such a study also does not allow you to make any claims that have been severely tested, but that should not be the goal of every study, especially in new research lines."

    "text": "13.7 Test Yourself\nIn this assignment we will go through the steps to complete a high-quality preregistration. This assignment will continue in the next chapter, where we will focus on a computationally reproducible analysis pipeline and implementing open science practices such as sharing data and code. Open science is a set of practices for reproducibility, transparency, sharing, and collaboration based on openness of data and tools that allows others to reuse and scrutinize research. You might want to complete this assignment for a real research project you are involved in. If you are not involved in any real research projects, you can perform a simple study analyzing publicly accessible data just for this assignment. I will illustrate this using a hypothesis that can be answered based on movie ratings on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB). You can come up with any hypothesis you want based on another data source (but don’t spend to much time on data collection, as that is not the goal if this assignment).\nTo organize your preregistration, you can follow templates others have created, which you can find at https://osf.io/zab38/wiki/home/. The default OSF preregistration template is good for hypothesis testing studies. Keep the JARS reporting guidelines in mind while writing your preregistration.\nOne of my favorite movies is Fight Club. It stars Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. At a conceptual level my hypothesis is that Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are both great actors, and because they are both great actors, the movies they play in are equally good. At an operationalized level my hypothesis is that on average movies that star Brad Pitt and Edward Norton will receive the same rating in the Internet Movie Database. IMDB provides both an IMDB rating, and the metascore (provided by metacritic.com).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.5: Screenshot of a IMDB and metacritic rating.\n\n\n\n\nI will operationalize movie ratings as the IMDB scores, and movies that star Brad Pitt or Edward Norton as all movies they have appeared in, according to the following two search commands on IMDB:\nFor Brad Pitt http://www.imdb.com/filmosearch?role=nm0000093&explore=title_type&mode=detail&page=1&title_type=movie&ref_=filmo_ref_job_typ&sort=release_date,desc&job_type=actor\nFor Edward Norton: http://www.imdb.com/filmosearch?role=nm0001570&explore=title_type&mode=detail&page=1&title_type=movie&ref_=filmo_ref_job_typ&sort=release_date,desc&job_type=actor\nQ1: Write down your hypothesis on a conceptual level. In some research areas you might be able to capture this hypothesis in in a formal quantitative model, but more often you will describe this hypothesis verbally. Try to be as precise as possible, even though all verbal descriptions of hypotheses will inherently be limited. It is also useful to discuss whether the data has already been collected, or not, and explain whether your hypothesis is influenced by knowledge about the data (in a typical preregistration, data will not have been collected).\nQ2: Write down your hypothesis on an operationalized level. All variables in the study (i.e., independent and/or dependent variables) should be clearly specified.\nThe next steps are to specify the hypothesis on a statistical level. Sometimes resources limit the statistical questions one can answer. Whenever this is the case, it is useful to first perform a sample size justification. If this is not the case, it is more useful to first specify the statistical question and then calculate the required sample size. As I already know that the number of movies Brad Pitt and Edward Norton appear in is limited, I will first proceed with a sample size justification.\nQ3: Justify your sample size. I will use my own Shiny app to go through the steps of a sample size justification.\n1.1: Describe the population you are sampling from.\nThe population consists of all movies that Brad Pitt and Edward Norton starred in (up to March 2023) since the start of their career, as indexed by the internet movie database (www.imdb.com). The total number of observations is limited by the movies Brad Pitt and Edward Norton have appeared in too date, which is 62 and 39, respectively.\n1.2: Can you collect data from the entire population?\nyes.\nThe total number of observations is limited by the movies Brad Pitt and Edward Norton have appeared in too date, which is 62 and 39, respectively.\n\nWhich Effect Sizes are of Interest?\n\nThe smallest effect size of interest is always a matter of discussion among peers. In this case, I personally believe a difference in movie ratings that is less than 0.5 on a 10 point scale (as used on the IMDB) is sufficiently small to support my prediction that movies with Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are equally good. In other words, if the raw difference is larger than -0.5 and smaller than 0.5, I will conclude the two sets of movies are rated equally well.\nThe minimal statistically detectable effect given the number of movies (62 and 39) can be computed by examining the effect we have 50% power for in an independent t-test, for example as computed by G*Power. Before we can compute the minimal statistically detectable effect, we need to specify our alpha level. We know our sample size is limited, and statistical power will be an issue. At the same time, we need to make a decision based on the available data, as it will take many years before we have a larger sample size. In such a context where the sample size is fixed, and a decision must be made, it is sensible to balance the Type 1 and Type 2 error in a compromise power analysis. Below, we determine an alpha level of 0.15 is a defensible decision. That means we have a rather high probability of incorrectly concluding the two groups of movies have the same rating, but we do so to reduce the probability of incorrectly concluding the two movies do not have the same rating, when they actually have.\n– Sunday, March 05, 2023 – 12:19:19\nt tests - Means: Difference between two independent means (two groups)\nAnalysis: Sensitivity: Compute required effect size\nInput: Tail(s) = Two\n$\\alpha$ err prob   =   0.15\n\nPower (1-$\\beta$ err prob)  =   0.5\n\nSample size group 1 =   62\n\nSample size group 2 =   39\nOutput: Noncentrality parameter \\(\\delta\\) = 1.4420104\nCritical t  =   1.4507883\n\nDf  =   99\n\nEffect size d   =   0.2947141\nThe Minimal Statistically Detectable Effect is thus d = 0.295.\nA sensitivity analysis shows that given the sample size we can collect (n = 62 and 39), and the smallest effect size of interest (half a scale point), and assuming a standard deviation of movie ratings of sd = 0.9 (an estimate based on pilot data), statistical power is 91% is we assume the difference in movie ratings is exactly 0. It is possible that movie ratings actually differ slightly, and the difference is not exactly 0. If we assume the true difference in movie ratings is 0.1 power is still 86%. This decent statistical power is a direct consequence of increasing the alpha level. With a 5% Type 1 error rate, power would be 64% (assuming a true difference between movies of 0.1), and the combined error rate would be ((100 - 64) + 5) = 41% , but by increasing the alpha level to 15% the combined error rate has dropped to ((100 - 86) + 15) = 29%, which means the probability of making an error, assuming H0 and H1 are equally likely to be true, has been reduced.\n\nTOSTER::power_t_TOST(\n  n = c(62, 39),\n  delta = 0.1,\n  sd = 0.9,\n  low_eqbound = -0.5,\n  high_eqbound = 0.5,\n  alpha = 0.05,\n  type = \"two.sample\"\n)\n\nWe can conclude that we will decent power for our planned test, given our smallest effect size of interest and our high alpha level.\n\nInferential goal\n\nOur inferential goal a statistical test while controlling our error rates, and therefore, we plan to make a decision. We use the sensitivity analysis above to justify our error rates (but we could also have used a compromise power analysis by more formally minimizing the combined error rate, Maier & Lakens (2022)).\n\nInformational Value of the Study\n\nFinally, we evaluate the informational value of our study. First, we are using all available data, and we have tried to reduce the combined Type 1 and Type 2 error rate by somewhat balancing the two error rates. Our goal is to make a decision based on the available data. Our decision has a relatively high probability to be wrong, but the value of our study is that is allows us to make a decision as well as possible, given the available data. Therefore, if anyone else wants to know the answer to the question if movies starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are indeed equally good, our results will give the best possible answer we currently have available, even if there is substantial remaining uncertainty after the study.\nQ4: Write down your hypothesis on a statistical level and specify the code for this analysis. Be as specific as possible. Look through the JARS recommendations above, and the checklist by Wicherts et al. (2016), to make sure you did not miss any details you need to specify (e.g., how will you pre-process the data, which software version will you use, etc.).\nWe can now specify the test we plan to perform on a statistical level. We do not expect any missing data or outliers, and will analyze all movie ratings in an equivalence test with equivalence bounds of -0.5 and 0.5, and alpha level of 0.15, and as group sizes are unequal Welch’s t-test (which does not assume equal variances) will be performed Delacre et al. (2017). The following analysis code (which I will run in R version 4.2.0, and TOSTER package version 0.4.1) assumes the data will be stored in the imdb_ratings dataframe with a column for the movie ratings for Brad Pitt (with the column name brad_pitt_score) and a column for the movie ratings for Edward Norton (with the column name edward_norton_score)\n\nTOSTER::t_TOST(\n  x = imdb_ratings$brad_pitt_score,\n  y = imdb_ratings$edward_norton_score,\n  low_eqbound = -0.5,\n  high_eqbound = 0.5,\n  eqbound_type = \"raw\",\n  alpha = 0.15,\n  var.equal = FALSE\n)\n\nFinally, we need to specify our criteria and how we will evaluate the results. The t_TOST function will also perform a null-hypothesis significance test, which is convenient, because we can now consider our hypothesis supported if the equivalence test is significant at p &lt; 0.15, or when the 70% confidence interval falls completely within the equivalence bounds. We can consider our hypothesis falsified if the null hypothesis significance test is significant at p &lt; 0.15. If neither of the two tests is significant, our results are inconclusive. If both tests are significant, our hypothesis is also falsified, as there is an effect, but it is too small to matter. So more formally, our hypothesis is corroborated if the TOST p &lt; 0.015 & NHST p &gt; 0.015, it is falsified if NHST p &lt; 0.015, and inconclusive otherwise.\nWe have now completed a preregistration of a very simple study. In real studies, the preregistration process is often not this easy. A sample size justification often requires some knowledge about the variables in your analysis, power analyses become more uncertain the more complex the analysis, and it might be challenging to make decisions about data pre-processing and how to deal with outliers. If you struggle with your preregistration, you might simply not be ready to preregister. You might not be in the tightening phase or your research, or the equivalent of a phase 3 trial in clinical trials, and need to perform more descriptive research before you can perform a real test of your hypothesis.\n\n13.7.1 Practical Aspects of an Online Preregistration\nOver the last years multiple online services have been created that allow you to preregister your hypothesis plan. I will discuss three solutions: ZPID, OSF, and AsPredicted. In decreasing order, these three services differ in how high they set the bar for researchers to preregister on their platform. ZPID is specific for psychological science, the OSF is accessible for anyone, and AsPredicted requires an email address from an academic institution to preregister.\nIf you preregister, your preregistration will be archived. This will cost time (at ZPID due to manual checks) and money (because of long-term data storage). You should only preregister real studies (even though AsPredicted allows class assignments as preregistrations). For an assignment it suffices to store a PDF file that contains all information related to your preregistration, without actually creating a time-stamped version in one of these databases.\n\n13.7.2 Pre-registering on PsychArchives by ZPID\nGo to https://pasa.psycharchives.org. Log in with your ORCID if you have one or can make one (which should be available to most people working or studying at a research institution), or make a dedicated Leibniz Psychology account.\nClick ‘Start a new submission’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand scroll down to the preregistration option and click it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see a recommendation to submit your preregistration in a PDF/A file, which is a PDF which does not allow certain restrictions that hinder long-term archiving. This already reveals how PsychArchives will ask you to meet certain standards that they deem best practices, that you might not think about yourself. This is a good thing!\nIn Microsoft word, you can save a file as a PDF/A compliant pdf file by choosing ‘File’&gt; ‘Save As’, choose PDF from the dropdown menu, click on ‘More options…’ below the dropdown menu:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the ‘Options…’ button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd check the box: PDF/A compliant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen opening a PDF/A compliant PDF, some PDF readers will show a warning message:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick ‘Next’. You can now upload a preregistration document. PsychArchives will motivate you to add descriptions and meta-data to files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou then choose a sharing level (level 0 means the file is for public use, level 1 is for scientific use only) and a license. Click ‘Save and Next’.\nNow we see why PsychArchives is setting a higher bar then some other services, because we need to specify meta-data for our file. This meta-data will make the files we share (such as a preregistration, the paper based on this preregistration, and the data and code used in the paper) more easily findable, which is important if the scientific community wants to reap the benefits of open science in the future. This preregistration is not yet linked to any other files, but in a real research project, future submissions to PsychArchives would be linked to this preregistration. Adding good descriptions about files also helps others to find them in the future.\nWhen you submit your preregistration, you will see that your preregistration will be manually checked. Staff at PsychArchives will check whether your submission adheres to all guidelines. If not, you will be told what to improve, and have to resubmit the file. Note that this check is about the uploaded files and meta-data – staff does not check the quality of your preregistration!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find the PsychArchives preregistration at the following persistent identifier link: https://doi.org/10.23668/psycharchives.12575\n\n13.7.3 Pre-registering on the Open Science Framework\nGo to www.osf.io, create an account or log in, and click the button ‘Create new project’. Enter a title. If you are from Europe, and you want to adhere to the GDPR privacy regulations, make sure to select ‘Germany’ as the storage location. Click ‘Create’, and click ‘Go to project’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a description, so that others will understand what this project is about, and a license, so that others know how they can re-use any material you are sharing.\nYou can choose to make your project public now, or to make it public later. It is common for researchers to make the project public upon publication, but if you are not worried about others re-using your content (and any ideas in it) you can make the project open immediately. To do so, click the ‘Make public’ button in the top right of the project.\nTo preregister a study, click the ‘Registrations’ button in the top bar, and click ‘new registration’.\nReminder: You should not use the OSF to preregister just to practice how to preregister. The OSF registries website is intended to be a searchable database of all official scientific registrations and preregistrations. When you complete a registration, it will remain in OSF Registries for ever, and there is no way to remove it. This costs money and reduces the usefulness of the database. Only register real studies.\nFor hypothesis testing research the default OSF preregistration template will provide a useful structure to your preregistration. It will also allow you to upload supplementary files (such as the html file detailing our sample size justification that we created above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will be asked a range of relevant questions to complete. For a completed preregistration related to the study comparing movie ratings of movies starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, see: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/RJYCP. Note that all pre-registrations on the OSF will become public after four years. This is the only platform where you will not be able to keep your preregistrations private indefinitely.\nTo share your preregistration during the review process, the OSF allows you to create a ’view-only. link. As long as you did not enter identifying information in any of the files in your project, peer reviewers will be able to see your preregistration, without revealing your identity: https://help.osf.io/article/201-create-a-view-only-link-for-a-project.\n\n13.7.4 Pre-registering on AsPredicted\nAsPredicted offers a preregistration service with a focus on simplicity. The website will not allow preregistrations that are too long. This can typically be accomplished by removing all justifications for choices from a preregistration document. This makes life easier for people who need to read the preregistration. AsPredicted focuses on distinguishing exploratory from confirmatory research, but because not all deviations from an analysis plan reduce the severity of a test, I think it is important to make sure the word limit does not limit the ability of peers to evaluate whether changes to the original analysis plan increase or reduce the severity of a test. If you feel the word limit constrains you when writing your preregistration, you can use the AsPredicted template on the OSF to preregister.\nGo to https://aspredicted.org/ and create a new AsPredicted pre-registration by clicking the ‘create’ button. Fill in your name, e-mail, and institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll down, and answer questions 1 to 11. At 2) paste your answer to Q1, at 3) paste your answer to Q2, at 4) explain how many groups you will compare (e.g., Edward Norton vs. Brad Pitt), at 5) and 6) enter the answer at Q4, and at 7) enter the answer from Q3. Answer the remaining questions. Please indicate at 10) that you are using AsPredicted for a ‘Class project or assignment’ if you want to complete an actual preregistration.\nPreview your pre-registration, and submit the preregistration. If you have added co-authors, they need to approve the submission. AsPredicted gives you the option to make an anonymous PDF file for peer review purposes, or you can just make the preregistration public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo share your preregistration during the review process, AsPredicted allows you to download an anonymous PDF. You can see the preregistration corresponding to the research question above at: https://aspredicted.org/nx35m.pdf\n\n\n\n\nAppelbaum, M., Cooper, H., Kline, R. B., Mayo-Wilson, E., Nezu, A.

    "text": "14.1 Step 1: Setting up a GitHub repository\nIn this assignment we will use github, but an open source alternative is to use GitLab. If you haven’t created a GitHub account before, do so now. Go to https://github.com/ and create an account. Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. Version control allows you to track changes to files and revert back to previous versions if needed. GitHub and GitLab are web-based hosting services that make it easier to use version control with Git. We will be using GitHub because it is what I am most familiar with, and it integrates with slightly more tools, but feel free to use GitLab instead.\nIf you have an account, you can create a new repository. A repository is a collection of folders and files that make up your project. In the top-right of the GitHub page, click the + symbol, and select ‘New repository’ from the dropdown menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing to do is name your repository. When it comes to naming folders and files, it is important to follow best practices for file naming:\n\nKeep names short, but clear. data_analysis_project is easier to understand for others than dat_an_prjct\n\nDo not use spaces. Options include:\n\nUnderscore: this_is_a_file.R (this is my personal favorite)\nCamelcase: ThisIsAFile.R\nDashes: this-is-a-file.R\nNo spaces: thisisafile.R\n\n\nIf you want to number multiple sequential files, do not use 1_start, 2_end, but use leading zeroes whenever you might number more than 10 files, so for example 01, 02, etc., or 001, 002, etc.\nDo not use special characters such as $#&*{}: in file names.\nIf you want to use date information, use the YYYYMMDD format.\n\nLet’s name our repository: reproducibility_assignment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add a short description (e.g., ‘This is an assignment to practice an open and reproducible data analysis workflow’). If you are an academic or student, you can get an academic account, which gives some extra options, such as keeping repositories private: https://education.github.com/pack\nClick the checkbox before ‘Initialize this repository with a README’. A readme file is a useful way to provide a more detailed description of your project, that will be visible when people visit your GitHub project page. It can also contain instructions on how to reproduce analyses, such as which files to run in which order, and any changes to files that need to be made as the files are run.\nYou are also asked whether you want to add a license. Adding a license is a way to easily communicate to others how they can use the data, code, and materials that you will share in your GitHub repository. Note that not making a choice about a license is also a choice: if you do not add a license your work is under exclusive copyright by default, which means others can’t easily re-use it. You can learn more about licenses, but for now, a simple choice is the MIT license, which puts only very limited restrictions on reuse, but more restrictive licenses also exist. You can select the choice of license (such as the MIT license) from the dropdown menu. It lets people do anything they want with your code as long as they provide attribution back to you and don’t hold you liable. There are also creative commons licenses that you can use when you are sharing something else than software, such as research materials (for example, this educational material is shared under a CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license).\nWe are now ready to create the repository. Click\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt might feel unintuitive, but it is important to remember that you are not expected to directly interact with your new GitHub repository through the GitHub website. The repository page will give you information about the contents of the repository, and the history of the files in the repository, but it is not particularly easy to add files or download files directly through the website. The idea is that you use other software to interact with your GitHub repository."

    "text": "14.2 Step 2: Cloning your GitHub repository into RStudio\nR Studio can communicate with GitHub. To allow RStudio to work together with GitHub, you first need to set up the system. A detailed explanation for different operating systems is provided here. First, download Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads for your operating system, and install it (you can accept all defaults during the installation process). If you haven’t done so already, download and install R: https://cran.r-project.org/, and download and install the free version of R Studio (scroll down for the installers): https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/.\nIn R Studio, go to Tools &gt; Global Options, and select the Git/SVN menu option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck if the Git executable (“git.exe”) has been found automatically. If not, you will need to click the ‘ Browse…’ button and find it manually. It will always be in the location where you installed Git.\nClick the ‘Create RSA Key…’ button. A window will appear:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can close the window. Still under the RStudio options, click the blue hyperlink ‘View public key’. A window will appear, telling you that you can use CTRL+C to copy the key. Do so.\nGo to GitHub, and go to settings and then select the option SSH and GPG keys:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick ‘New SSH key’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter a name (e.g., RStudio) and paste the key in the correct window. Click ‘Add SSH Key’. This will allow you to send code from R Studio to your GitHub repositories without having to enter your GitHub login name and password every time. In other words, R Studio is now connected to your GitHub account and repository. You are now ready to create a version controlled project in R Studio.\nRestart RStudio. In RStudio, go to File&gt;New Project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou get three choices. Choose the ‘Version Control’ option:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose the ‘Git’ option:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be cloning the online GitHub repository we created. Cloning is a term used in Git that means creating a local copy of all files in your repository on your computer. You can copy-paste the URL from your GitHub repository (e.g., https://github.com/Lakens/reproducibility_assignment). If you copy-paste this URL in the top field, it will automatically create a Project directory name that is similar to the name you gave your project on GitHub. You can select a folder on your computer by clicking the ‘Browse’ button to indicate where you want to save the local copy of your repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick ‘Create Project’. R will quickly download the files from your repository, and open the new project. You will see that the project creation was successful because the ‘Files’ tab in the RStudio interface shows we have downloaded some files from our GitHub repository (the README.md and LICENSE files). RStudio also created a .Rproj file and a .gitignore file. The project file is used to store information about the project, and that is required to use GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also see this is a version control project in the top right of the interface, where there is now a ‘Git’ tab. If we click it, we see:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see a range of buttons, such as the Diff, Commit, Pull, and Push buttons. These will be used to interact with GitHub. Many computer programmers interact with GitHub through the command line, such as:\n$ git commit -m “This is a git commit message”\nLearning to use git through the command line is not needed for most people who just want basic version control. Here, I will exclusively focus on version control and git through the menu options in RStudio. It is now time to create a file for which we want to control the versions we make of it."

    "text": "14.3 Step 3: Creating an R Markdown file\nR Markdown files provide a way to save and execute code, while at the same time allowing you to create reports of your data analysis (and even full scientific articles that you can submit for publication!). A complete introduction to R Markdown is available here. The main strength of R Markdown documents is that they allow you to create a fully reproducible document. This means that you do not just have some analysis code in an R script, but a manuscript that combines text and code and that you can compile to create a PDF or html version of the manuscript. HTML or PDF files have the advantage that people can read them with regular software. The R Markdown file contains code that performs the analyses each time the document is compiled. Instead of copy-pasting values from your analysis software into a word document, you combine code and text in the RMarkdown file to create a manuscript where every number or figure can be traced back to the exact code that generated it. That has the advantage that everyone can use your RMarkdown file and generate the same document (e.g., your manuscript) as you.\nYou can still make errors in the analysis if you use R Markdown files. The important difference is that you will be making programming errors that are stored in the R Markdown document. Compared to a typo when copying numbers from your analysis to a word document, errors in your analysis in your RMarkdown file will lead to the same document. Because the document is reproducible, all errors are reproducible as well. It is impossible to prevent all errors, but it is possible to make them reproducible. This will make it easier to identify and correct errors. I understand you might worry about others seeing your errors if you allow them to see exactly what you have done. But we all make mistakes, and it is important for science to be able to identify and correct these mistakes. An important aspect of moving to a more reproducible workflow, and sharing all files underlying your manuscript publicly, is that we will have to learn to accept that we all make errors, and appreciate people who correct them (Bishop, 2018).\nLet’s start by creating a new R Markdown document in R Studio by clicking New File &gt; R Markdown…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives you a new window where you can specify the title of your RMarkdown document and an author name. Enter the title ‘Main Analysis’, and feel free to change the Author subfield to anything you prefer. RMarkdown files can be compiled (also referred to as ‘knitted’) into an HTML file, a PDF document, or a word document. To generate PDF files you need to install MiKTex which we won’t do for this example (a good tutorial how to install MiKTeX is available here). So leave the default output format to HTML and click OK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start by saving the new file: Click the save button, and save the file under the name ‘main_analysis.Rmd’. Because we are working in an R Studio project, the file will automatically be saved in the same folder as all other files in this project. If you look at the files tab in the bottom right pane, you will see the new file appear. Now let’s take a look at the R Markdown file.\nThe R Markdown file by default includes several sections to get you started. First, there is a header section. In the header section, there is code that determines how the final document is rendered. This section is sensitive, in the sense that it needs to be programmed exactly right – including spaces and tabs – so it is not recommended to change it too much without looking up detailed documentation on how to change this section. If you want the technical details: An R Markdown file is fed to knitr software, which creates a normal markdown file, which then uses pandoc software to generate the specific document you requested. All of this happens automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe header is followed by a set-up section where you can define general options for the entire R Markdown file. Then, we see the two main sections: Markdown code, which is a markup language in plain text formatting syntax that can be easily converted into HTML or other formats. Then, we see R code that is used to analyze data or create figures. To see the final result of this code, hit the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnit button in the toolbar at the top of the pane.\nEither a new window will appear that allows you to view the HTML file that was created, or your document will appear in the ‘viewer’ tab in RStudio. You see the formatted HTML document that combined both text and the output of R code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose the window – we are now ready to analyze our data."

We will download this data directly from an existing GitHub repository I created. Students in an introduction to psychology course performed a simple Stroop experiment. During the Stroop experiment participants named the colors in a congruent trial (e.g., the word ‘red’ written in a red font) and incongruent trial (e.g., the word ‘red’ written in a green font). The time they took to name all words was recorded in seconds (e.g., 21.3 seconds) for both the congruent and incongruent trial. There are four columns in the dataset:\n\nParticipant Number\nResponse Time for Congruent Stimuli\nResponse Time for Incongruent Stimuli\nYear of Data Collection\n\nClick the button ‘+C Insert’ to insert code – a dropdown menu will be visible. Select R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the R Markdown file, you’ll see a new section of R code that starts with three backticks followed by {r} and ends with three backticks. You can also just create these sections by manually typing in these two lines.\nCopy-paste the code below – make sure to get all the text – and paste it between the start line and the end line of the R code chunk.\n\nstroop_data &lt;- read.table(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lakens/Stroop/master/stroop.txt\",\nsep = \"\\\\t\", header = TRUE)`\n\nwrite.table(stroop_data, file = \"stroop.csv\", quote = F, row.names = F)\n\nAfter copy-pasting the text, the code section should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code creates a data.frame called ‘stroop_data” that contains data, and then saves this data in a .csv file called ‘stroop.csv’. Click the Knit button to look at the document:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see something like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis might not look very impressive – but the real action is in the file pane in the bottom right part of the screen. Close the window showing the HTML output and look at the file pane. You should now see several files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne file is stroop.csv – this is our data file of the Stroop data that we downloaded from the internet and saved to our project folder, using R code.\nThere is really no need to keep downloading the file from the internet when we can also just load it from the local folder. So let’s change the code. We won’t completely delete this code – we will just comment it out by placing a # in front of it. This way, we can still remember where we downloaded the file from, but we won’t use the code.\nBecause it is always important to provide comments in the code you write, add this explanation above the line where we downloaded the code:\n#run only once to download the data\nThen, select the lines of code in the chunk, and press (on Windows) CTRL+SHIFT+C (or click ‘Code’ in the toolbar and then ‘comment/uncomment lines’). This should add # in front of all lines, making it comments instead of code that is executed every time. You should end up with:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we need to add a line of code that we will run, and with which we will load the stroop.csv dataset from the local folder. Underneath the last commented out line of code, but within the R code block, add:\nstroop_data &lt;- read.csv(\"stroop.csv\", sep = \" \", header = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick save, or press CTRL+S, to save the file. Knit the file. We see:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose the HTML file. We’ve done quite a lot of work. It would be a shame if this work was lost. So this seems to be the perfect time to save a version of our R Markdown file, not just locally, but also on GitHub."

    "text": "14.5 Step 5: Committing and Pushing to GitHub\nIt is time to store our changes in the cloud, on GitHub. This process takes two steps. First, we record the changes to the repository (aka the code and files we created), which is called ‘commit’. This does not require an internet connection, because we are just recording the changes locally. However, then we want to make sure these recorded changes are also stored on GitHub, which requires you to push the files to GitHub.\nIf we look at the Git tab in the top right pane in R Studio, we see the Commit button, the Push button, and we see a bunch of files. The status of these files is indicated by two question marks in yellow. These question marks indicate these files are not yet tracked by GitHub. Let’s change this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the commit button. A menu opens. You can choose to ‘stage’ the changes that have been made. Staging basically mean selecting which of the files you want to record, or commit. You can do this in several ways, such as double clicking each file, or selecting all files and clicking ‘Enter’. When staging all files, the yellow question marks change to a green ‘A’ symbol. Every commit should be accompanied by a commit message where you describe which changes you have made – after all, we are recording our changes. You can type in anything you want – it is common to write something like ‘initial commit’ the first time you commit changes. The menu should look like the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we are ready to commit these changes. Click the ‘Commit’ button. A new window opens that shows all changes that have been committed. We see that 5 files have changed. You can close this window and close the previous menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Studio now reminds you that there is a difference between the local copy of your repository, and the remote version of the repository on GitHub. In the Git tab you see a reminder: “Your branch is ahead of ‘origin/master’ by 1 commit.”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means the files we have updated and recorded on our computer with a commit are not yet synchronized with the remote repository on GitHub. We can solve that by ‘pushing’ (aka synchronizing) the changes to the remote repository. Simply click the push button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother pop-up window appears:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis window informs us there were no errors, and we successfully pushed the changes to the remote version of the repository. You can close this window.\nYou can check that you successfully pushed all files to GitHub by visiting the GitHub page for your repository in the browser. You should see something like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations on your first GitHub push! If you want to read a more extensive introduction to Git, see Vuorre & Curley (2018)."

    "text": "14.6 Step 6: Reproducible Data Analysis\nSo far, we have only read in data. The goal of an R Markdown file is to create a manuscript that contains a fully reproducible data analysis. In this chapter, I cannot teach you how to analyze data in R (but I can highly recommend learning it – there are plenty of excellent online resources). Instead of programming from scratch, visit this raw text version of the R Markdown file that will analyze the Stroop data. In the website, select all text (CTRL+A), copy it (CTRL+C). Then go to your main_analysis.Rmd file in R Studio. Select all text (CTRL+A) and press delete. That’s right – delete everything. You don’t need to worry about losing anything – you have a version controlled file in your GitHub repository, which means you can always go back to a previous version! In the (now empty) main_analysis.Rmd file, press CTRL+V and paste all text. The file should look like the first screenshot below.\nThis R Markdown file does a number of things, which we will explain in detail below. For example, it will automatically install libraries it needs, load the data, and create a report in HTML. You can press the Knit button, and the HTML document should load. You should see output as in the second screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that none of the numbers that are in this text are static, or copy-pasted. They are all calculated at the moment that the document is created, directly from the raw data. The same is true for the figures, which are created from the raw data the moment the manuscript is compiled. If you have access to the .Rmd (RMarkdown) file, you can perfectly reproduce the reported data analysis.\nSince we have made substantial changes, this is the perfect moment to commit and push the changes to GitHub! Go to the Git tab in the top right pane. Click ‘Commit’. The window below will open. If the main_analysis.Rmd file is selected, you will see red and green chunks of text. These tell you what was old (red) and what is new (green).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect all files that have changed, and ‘stage’ them (for example by pressing enter). The checkboxes in front of the files, under the ‘Staged’ column, should be checked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType in a commit message, such as ‘update mean analysis’ in the ‘commit message’ field. Press the ‘Commit’ button. Close the window that pops up to inform you about the result of the commit. Then click ‘push’. Close the window that informs you about the push command, and close the commit window. You can always visit the GitHub repository online and look at the full history of your document to see all changes that have been made.\nLet’s take a look at some sections of our new R Markdown document. First the header:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sets general (global) options for the code chunks in the R Markdown file. The echo, warning, and message = FALSE hide the code chunks, warning messages, and other messages, where the ‘include=true’ will make all figures appear in the text. You can set some of these variables to TRUE, and hit Knit to see what they change. Sometimes you might want to share the HTML file with all code visible, for example when sharing with collaborators.\nIf you scroll down, you can see the introduction text, the code that generates the first figure, and the code that performs the analyses. These variables are used in the Results section. Let’s look at this section:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section shows how you can mix text and R code. The start of this code is normal text. The *M* is still normal text (the * and * make sure the M is italicized, just as further down the ~av~ indicates these letters should be subscript), but then you see R code. In R Markdown you can embed R code within `r`. Any R code within the two backticks will be executed. In this case, the mea of the Congruent reaction times is calculated, and rounded to 2 digits. You can see this number in the text.\nLearning to program takes time. You can see some things are quite tricky to program. For example, the code:\n\nifelse(ttest_result$p.value &gt; 0.001,\" = \", \" &lt; \")\nifelse(ttest_result$p.value &gt; 0.001, formatC(round(ttest_result$p.value,\n digits = 3), digits = 3, format = \"f\"), \"0.001\")\n\nis a lot of code to make sure the exact p-value is reported, unless this p-value is smaller than 0.001, in which case ‘p &lt; 0.001’ is printed (the papaja package below makes reporting statistics a lot easier!). The first time you need to program something like this takes a lot of time – but remember you can re-use code in the future, and you can steal a lot of code from others! You can complete a full introduction to Markdown here.\n\n14.6.1 Extra: APA formatted manuscripts in papaja\nIf you want to write a reproducible manuscript in APA style (common in for example psychology) you might want to try out the R package papaja created by Frederik Aust. Install the papaja package. Restart RStudio.Then, create a new R Markdown document, but instead of selecting the document option, select the ‘From Template’ option, and select the template APA article (6th edition) provided by the papaja package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see a template with a lot of fields for you to fill in, such as the title, author names and affiliation, the author note, the abstract, etc. Papaja takes care that all this information ends up in a nice lay-out – exactly following the APA rules. This means that if you have installed MiKTeX (to be able to convert to PDF), you can knit the document to a pdf, and submit an APA formatted document that is completely reproducible.

In general, I recommend the TIER protocol: https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/. If you share a datafile that is slightly larger than the one in this example, make sure you add a codebook so others understand what all variables mean. For a nice package that can help you to generate a machine readable codebook, see Arslan (2019).\nWhen you are organizing your code, take great care to make sure that any personally identifying information in your data is stored safely. Open science is great, but you are responsible to share data responsibly. This means that you need to ask participants permission to share their data in the informed consent form (a useful resource is the Research Data Management Support page of the University of Utrecht). Whenever you collect personal data, make sure you handle this data responsibly. Information specialists at your university library should be able to help."

    "section": "\n14.8 Step 8: Archiving Your Data and Code",
    "text": "14.8 Step 8: Archiving Your Data and Code\nAlthough we have uploaded our data and code to GitHub, when you publish your article and want to share your data and code, it is important to remember that GitHub is not a data repository that guarantees long term data storage. GitHub is currently owned by Microsoft, and companies can choose to do with their free service whatever they want. This makes it less suitable to link to GitHub in scientific articles, because articles could be around for decades from now. For scientific publications, you will want to link to a stable long-term data repository. For a list of data repositories, click HERE. We will use the Open Science Framework (OSF) in this example as a stable data storage, because it is very easy to just integrate our GitHub repository within an OSF project.\nLog in to the OSF at https://osf.io/ (create an account if you haven’t already done so). Click ‘Create new project’. Give your project a name (for example ‘Stroop Reproducible Analysis Assignment’).\nIt is again important to add a license to your work, also on your OSF project. After having created a project, you can click ‘Add a license’:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can again choose an MIT license. You will have to fill in a year, and the copyright holders – in this case, that is you, so fill in your name (it will appear in the license text). Then click\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we could upload all our files to the OSF, we can also simply link our GitHub project to the OSF. In the menu bar of the OSF project, click on ‘Add-ons’. In the list, scroll to GitHub:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the step-by-step guide to connect to GitHub provided by the OSF: https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019929813-Connect-GitHub-to-a-Project\nSelect your repository that contains the reproducibility assignment and click ‘Save’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the title of the OSF project page to go back to the main project page. You will now see in the ‘Files’ pane that the GitHub repository is linked:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a good moment to click the ‘Make Public’ button in the top right of your project. After making the project public, people will be able to find it on the OSF. If you don’t want to make your project public just yet, but you do want to give others access to your files, you can create a ‘View-only’ link on the OSF. Go to ‘Contributors’ and click the +Add button next to View-only links. For a step-by-step guide, see this tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use a view-only link to share access to your files only with reviewers. You can create an anonymized view-only link to hide your contributor names in the project - this is particularly useful in blinded peer review. Giving access to the files during peer review greatly helps reviewers – it will be a lot easier for them to answer any questions they might have about your materials, data, or code. Be aware it means that people you don’t know will have access to your files. So far, I don’t know of any negative experiences with this process, but it is important to be aware that others have access to your files before they are published.\nThe OSF page now just links to the files on the GitHub page. It does not independently store them. This means we do not yet have a long term stable data storage solution.\nTo create a snapshot of all files in the GitHub repository that will be stored for a long time, you have to create a Registration of your project. We will not create a Registration of your project in this example. Creating a registration starts several formal procedures: data in linked repositories (such as GitHub) are stored by the OSF, and the project appears in the list of registrations. You should only register when you want to create a stable copy of your work. Below you see an example of the files in an OSF project that has been registered. You see that the GitHub repository that was linked to the project has been turned into an Archive of GitHub – this creates a stable version of the project, as it was at the moment you registered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA good moment to create a stable version of your project is when your manuscript is accepted for publication. You can create a Registration and use the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to link to the code, data, and materials in the paper (you can add this link to the DOI to the manuscript as you check the proofs of your article before it is published). Note that it is recommended to link to the materials using the DOI. The DOI is a persistent link (meaning it will keep working) where a website address might change. A registration does not automatically get a DOI. After creating the Registration, you need to click the ‘Create DOI’ link to create a persistent object identifier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are ready to create a Registration, follow the instructions on the OSF: https://help.osf.io/article/158-create-a-preregistration. As an example of a Registration that was made to store all work related to one of my scientific publications, see https://doi.org//10.17605/OSF.IO/9Z6WB (this link is itself an example of how to link to an OSF project using a DOI).\n\n14.8.1 EXTRA: Sharing Reproducible Code on Code Ocean\nIf you have used the workflow above to create a reproducible manuscript, you might want to make it easy for other people to explore your data and code. People can simply clone your GitHub repository – but this still requires them to install the software you used, and even if they have R installed, it requires them to install the packages you used to analyze your data. This can potentially lead to reproducibility problems. Packages in R update and change over time, and code that works on one machine might not run well on another computer. Furthermore, even when shared perfectly, downloading all files and getting the code up and running takes time. Several solutions exist, such as Packrat, which is a dependency management system for R, or Docker, which can create a container that works as a virtual machine that includes a computing environment including all the libraries, code and data that you need to reproduce an analysis (Wiebels & Moreau, 2021).\nHere, I’ll focus on a software solution that is designed to be easier to use than Docker, but provides many of the same benefits, called Code Ocean. Code Ocean is a cloud-based computational reproducibility platform. You can create a computing capsule that runs online and contains all packages your code needs to run. Although Code Ocean does not (yet) guarantee long term storage of data and code, it is an interesting way to make your reproducible code available to fellow researchers, and makes it very easy for researchers (or reviewers) to make small changes to your code, and examine the results. Create a (free) account on CodeOcean. Go to the dashboard. Click the ‘New Capsule’ button and choose the option ’Import Git Repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the web address of your GitHub repository and click import.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on ‘Environment’ in the left pane. In the middle pane, click the R icon to select the programming language. At the time of writing this part of the chapter, the default language is 3.5.3, but you can click on ‘2 more versions’ and select the newest R version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to set up the Code Ocean environment to contain the packages we need. Click +Add behind apt-get, and type pandoc and click the return key two times (no need to specify a version of pandoc). Click +Add behind R (CRAN) and type in ggplot2, and click return twice (no need to select a specific version). Click +Add again, and type reshape2, click return twice. Click add once more, and type rmarkdown and click return twice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the left pane, drag and drop the main_analysis.Rmd file into the ‘code’ folder, and the ‘stroop.csv’ file into the ‘data’ folder. Select the code folder, and click the + button in the bar on the top of the left pane to add a file. Name the file ‘run.sh’. This file will tell Code Ocean what to run. Select the file. The middle pane will be empty. Add the following code:\n\\#!/bin/bash\nRscript -e \"rmarkdown::render(input = 'main_analysis.Rmd', \\\\\noutput_dir = '../results', clean = TRUE)\"\nWe need to make one final change. Select the main_analysis.Rmd. Scroll down to line 28 where the data is read in. Change:\nstroop_data \\&lt;- read.csv(\"stroop.csv\", sep = \" \", header = TRUE)\nto\nstroop_data \\&lt;- read.csv(\"../data/stroop.csv\", sep = \" \", header = TRUE)\nWe are no all done! Click the ‘Reproducible Run’ button in the right pane. You will get output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the ‘main_analysis.html’. You will see the script has generated our reproducible results. Commit the changes. You could (in principle – for this example we won’t) make this completely reproducible container openly available and share it with your published paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is now a completely reproducible analysis file online. Anyone cannot just reproduce your data analysis – they can go into the main_analysis.Rmd file, and change anything they want in your code, and run it again. For example, let’s say you dislike the black straight line in the first scatterplot, and you want it to be red. It is easy to change ‘black’ to ‘red’ in line 42, and re-run the analysis, and you will get a figure with a red line. Although that might in itself not be very exciting, the ability to easily re-analyze data might be useful in more realistic scenarios. For example, imagine you are reviewing a paper where the researchers do not plot the data. Without having to install any software, you can just type in hist(stroop_data$Congruent) after the data has been read in (e.g., on line 30), run the code again, and you will see a histogram for the reaction times in the Congruent condition. Give it a try."

    "text": "14.9 Some points for improvement in computational reproducibility\nWe recently tried to computationally reproduce Registered Reports published in the psychological literature (Obels et al., 2020). We noticed some issues that, if solved, would easily improve the computational reproducibility of your work.\nFirst, always add a codebook to data files. We already noted this above, and yes, it is a bit of work and not that fun to do, but it is very essential to include a codebook when you share data. Data is easier to understand and more reusable if variables and their values are clearly described. Researchers should ensure that the codebook and variable names are in the same language as the article.\nSecond, annotate code so it is clear what the code does. Well-annotated code makes clear what the analysis code does, in which order scripts should be run if there are multiple scripts (e.g., to pre-process the raw data, compute sum scores, analyze the results, and generate graphs), and which output each section of analysis code generates. Sometimes it might even be helpful to, from the final manuscript, copy-paste the sentences in the results section back into the code file, so it is very clear how sentences in the manuscript relate to the code file. It also helps to clearly structure code (e.g., using a README) so others know which output analysis code creates and in which order code should be run.\nThird, check whether the code you shared still reproduces all analyses after revisions - researchers often make changes during the peer review process, but forget to update their analysis files.\nFinally, remember that most code in R relies on specific libraries (also called packages). List all the packages that the code needs to run at the top of the script. Because packages update, it is necessary to report the version numbers of packages that were used (for example using packrat, or copying the output of the sessionInfo() function as a comment in the script). Remember that folder names and folder structures differ between computers, and therefore you should use relative locations (and not absolute paths like “c:/user/myfolder/code”). RStudio projects and the ‘here’ package provide an easy way to use relative paths. When multiple scripts are used in the analysis, include the order in which scripts should be performed on the data in a README file."

Following through the example here is not the same as being able to use these tools in your research. Learning to use these tools will take time. There will be many frustrations when the code or software doesn’t work as you want, or when you have gotten your local and remote GitHub repositories so much out of sync you just need to delete everything on your local computer and re-download all files from GitHub (git reset –hard [HEAD] is your friend). There are a lot of resources available online to find answers, or to ask for help. In my experience, it is some work, but it is doable, even if you have very limited knowledge of programming. You can get a basic reproducible workflow up and running by simply using all the steps described here, and then learn new skills as you need them. Learning these skills is appreciated both within and outside of academia (which is useful for PhD students) and will quickly save you time (e.g., when recreating figures for a revision, or when analyzing very similar datasets in the future). A reproducible workflow also improves the quality of your scientific work, and makes it easier for other scientists to re-use your work in the future.

    "section": "\n15.1 Questionable Research Practices",
    "text": "15.1 Questionable Research Practices\nAlthough in theory all researchers should follow the code of conduct for research integrity, many researchers do not. Researchers across scientific disciplines admit to certain practices that have been dubbed ‘questionable research practices’. This name is somewhat unfortunate, as most of these practices are not questionable at all, but directly violate the code of conduct. That they are nevertheless referred to as ‘questionable’ is mainly because many researchers were not aware of the problematic nature of these practices, and slowly needed to accept how problematic they always were.\nQuestionable research practices generally describe practices that violate the requirement from the code of conduct to “Make sure that the choice of research methods, data analysis, assessment of results and consideration of possible explanations is not determined by non-scientific or non-scholarly (e.g. commercial or political) interests, arguments or preferences.” In additional to commercial or political interests, many scientists have an interest in publishing scientific articles, as doing so is good for their career. Questionable research practices make it easier for researchers to publish their article, either because they increase the probability of being able to report statistically significant results, or because they hide imperfections, which makes the results seem more convincing than they are. These practices come at the expense of the truth.\nResearcher admit to engaging in questionable research practices, and depending on the community of researchers surveyed, several problematic practices are engaged in at least once by many scholars. Figure 15.1 summarizes the results from 14 different surveys (Agnoli et al., 2017; Bakker et al., 2021; Chin et al., 2021; Fiedler & Schwarz, 2016; Fraser et al., 2018; John et al., 2012; Latan et al., 2021; Makel et al., 2021; Moran et al., 2022; Motyl et al., 2017; Rabelo et al., 2020; Swift et al., 2022). However, coding of open ended questions suggest there is substantial measurement error when participants answer these items, so it is unclear whether the percentages in Figure 15.1 directly translate into the percentage of researchers actually engaging in questionable practices (Motyl et al., 2017).\nMany researchers selectively publish only those results or analyses with significant results, despite the Dutch code of conduct stipulating that researchers should “Do justice to all research results obtained.” and the European code of conduct stating that “Authors and publishers consider negative results to be as valid as positive findings for publication and dissemination.” Registered Reports have been an important step in aligning research practices with the code of conduct when it comes to publishing null results.\nResearchers also flexibly analyse their data by selectively reporting conditions, measures, covariates, and a host of other data analytic strategies that inflate the Type 1 error rate, and increase the probability of obtaining a statistically significant result. Preregistration has been an important step of increasing the transparency of data-driven choices in the analyses reported in scientific articles, and allows researchers to evaluate whether any deviations from the statistical analysis plan decrease the severity of the test, or increase it (Lakens, 2019). With increasing awareness of the problematic nature of these practices, hopefully we will see a strong decline in their occurrence, and researchers will learn correct approaches to maintain some flexibility in their analyses (for example by replacing optional stopping by sequential analysis. Wigboldus & Dotsch (2016) make the important distinction between questionable research practices, and questionable reporting practices. Whenever in doubt, transparently reporting the decisions you made while analyzing data should give researchers all the information they need to evaluate the reported results.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.1: Self-admittance of engaging in a questionable research practices at least once from 14 surveys among a variety of samples of researchers."

    "section": "\n15.2 Fabrication, Falsification, and Plagiarism",
    "text": "15.2 Fabrication, Falsification, and Plagiarism\nBeyond questionable research practices, fabricating data is making up results and recording them as if they were real, and falsification is manipulating manipulating aspects of research, including data, without any scientific justification. Data fabrication is a research practice that is outright dishonest. There have been a substantial number of cases where researchers have fabricated complete datasets in dozens of experiments. Some examples were already mentioned in the chapter on [bias detection](#sec-bias. It can be difficult to prove fabrication, as researchers often keep bad records of data collection. For example, Susannah Cahalan makes a convincing case in her book ‘The Great Pretender’ that the famous study by David Rosehan ‘On being sane in insane places’ was largely made up. In the study, healthy confederates who pretended to hear voices were admitted as in-patients suffering from schizophrenia. Her detailed investigation raises severe doubts the study was performed as described (see also Scull (2023)).\nOne might hope falsification and fabrication is rare, but a recent large scale survey in The Netherlands yielded prevalence estimates around 4% (Gopalakrishna et al., 2022). Data fabrication can also occur on a smaller scale. Imagine collecting data for a study. As part of the study, it is your task to ask the age of participants and their gender, for the demographic statistics to be reported when describing the sample. After collecting all the data, you notice you have forgotten to collect the demographic data for two individuals. You might be tempted to, based on your memory, guess the demographic statistics of these two individuals, to not have to admit you have made a mistake during the data collection when you wrote up the demographic information. However, this would also constitute data fabrication. You should instead transparently mention a mistake was made. Mistakes happen, and it is important to create a culture where people can admit mistakes, so that we can learn from them and prevent them in the future (Bishop, 2018).\nNote that it can be fine to simulate data to perform a power analysis – one should just not present such data as if it was collected from real participants. The Dutch code of conduct states: “Do not fabricate data or research results and do not report fabricated material as if it were fact. Do justice to all research results obtained. Do not remove or change results without explicit and proper justification. Do not add fabricated data during the data analysis.”\nThe European code of conduct defines plagiarisms as: using other people’s work and ideas without giving proper credit to the original source, thus violating the rights of the original author(s) to their intellectual outputs.” It is possible to re-use text, but the source should be cited, and quotation marks should be used to identify the text as a quote from another source. A special case of plagiarism is ‘self-plagiarism’ or text recycling where the same text by the same author is used in different articles. There is disagreement about how problematic this practice is (Bird & Sivilotti, 2008), which is to be expected, as there will always be some academics with a diverging opinion. In general, researchers are not supposed to re-use large portions of previous work and present it as new work just to increase their number of published articles. But many researchers believe it is perfectly fine to re-use descriptions from method sections if you need to communicate the same information in a new paper (Pemberton et al., 2019). The guidelines by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) similarly state:\n\nThe guidelines cover how to deal with text recycling both in a submitted manuscript and a published article and include situations where text recycling may be acceptable as well as those where it is unlikely to be. For example, it may be entirely appropriate to have overlap in a methods section of a research article (referring to a previously used method) with citation of the original article. However, undisclosed overlap, or overlap in the results, discussion, or conclusions is unlikely to be acceptable.\n\nSelf-plagiarism is thus mainly seen as problematic when researchers use it to publish very similar content multiple times purely to make it look like they are more productive.\nThere are additional problematic research practices beyond fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, and QRP’s. Gopalakrishna et al. (2022) also considered behavior such as insufficiently mentoring or supervising junior researchers, unfairly reviewing articles or grants, and inadequate note-taking of the research done as questionable practices."

    "text": "15.3 Informed consent and data privacy\nWhen collecting data from participants outside of naturalistic observations in the public space, they should consent to participate in research. A consent form that participants read and sign before data collection is important both for research ethics, as for data privacy. The consent form explains the goal of the study, highlights that participation is voluntary and that participants can stop when they want, explains any risks and benefits (such as payment), informs them about data privacy issues, and details who participants can contact if there are any issues with the study.\nConsent is also the legal basis for the use of personal data in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The consent form should identify the data controller and the contact details of the Data Protection Officer, and a description of the participants’ rights (e.g., to withdraw the data up to a certain amount of time after the study), and information about where and how long data is stored and shared (Hallinan et al., 2023). According to the GDPR there are special categories of personal data that you can only collect with informed consent, such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, genetic or biometric data data, and questions about a person’s sex life or sexual orientation. When collecting such data, it should be necessary for the research purpose. Data privacy officers at your university can assist you in this process.\nOpen data is important - but it is essential to maintain data privacy when sharing data in a public repository. This means carefully removing any personal identifiers (names, IP addresses, ID numbers of participants from data panels, etc) from the dataset before publicly sharing the data. If you use a version control system make sure that the identifying information is absent from the initial version of the data files you will share, as other users will not just have access to the latest version of the file, but also to the complete file history. For a good overview on the GDPR and research, see this information from Groningen University."

    "section": "\n15.4 Conflicts of Interest",
    "text": "15.4 Conflicts of Interest\nA conflict of interest in research is any situation in which a researcher has interests in the outcome of the research that may lead to a personal advantage that can get in the way of generating true knowledge. A central feature of a conflict of interest is that there are two competing interests: one for doing good research, and one for failing to do good research. For example, a researcher might receive additional income as a consultant for a company, while working on a study that evaluates a product this company produces, such as a novel drug. If the study shows the drug does not have any benefits compared to existing drugs, a researcher might worry that honestly communicating this research finding will make the company decide to no longer hire their services as a consultant. Or a researcher might work for an advocacy organization and perform a study on the same topic that examines how many people are impacted by this topic, where high estimates might be in the interest of the advocacy organization. An argument can be made that scientists have a conflict of interest whenever they publish a scientific paper, as publishing is good for the career of a scientist, and studies are easier to publish when\nSimply having a conflict of interest is not a violation of the code of conduct, as long as researchers are transparent about it. The European code of conduct states: “All authors disclose any conflicts of interest and financial or other types of support for the research or for the publication of its results.” Conflicts of interest can also emerge when you review the scientific work of peers (e.g., grant proposals, or scientific articles). Here, personal relationships can become a conflict of interest, either because you are very close friends with a researcher, or because you feel the other researcher is a rival or competitor. In those situations, you should again declare your conflict of interest, and an editor or grant review panel will typically try to find another reviewer."

    "section": "\n15.5 Research ethics",
    "text": "15.5 Research ethics\nBefore you perform research most institutions require you to obtain permission from an ethical review board (ERB), or sometimes called an institutional review board (IRB). Specific types of research might be reviewed by specialized boards. For example, medical research is reviewed a medical ethics review committee (METC), and animal research by an animal ethics committee. The goal of ethics review is to balance two goals: to protect subjects and to enable research that will benefit society (Whitney, 2016). The Declaration of Helsinki provides an important basis of the evaluation of research on human subjects. It highlights the right of individuals for self-determination and the right to make informed decisions whether they want to participate or stop participating in research.\nThe Declaration of Helsinki builds on the Nuremberg Code, a set of ethical principles developed after the second world war in response to unethical research Nazi doctors performed on unconsenting prisoners in concentration camps (for an ethical discussion about whether this unethical research should be used and cited, see Caplan (2021) and Moe (1984)). Another example of unethical experiments on human subjects is the Tuskegee syphilis study where 400 African American men with syphilis were included in a study to examine the effects of the disease when untreated. The men included in the study did not give consent to go untreated and did not receive their diagnosis. The study ended up continuing for 40 years. Although most studies that are performed at universities have a much lower risk of harm, it is still important to evaluate the possible harm to participants against the benefits for science. Researchers might show negative stimuli, or ask participants to remember events they experienced as negative, which can still be experienced as harmful. There might be equally effective alternatives that can be used when designing a study, that will still allow a researcher to answer their research question. In addition to preventing harm, researchers must inform participants about the study and ask for their consent to participate. The information in the informed consent should be truthful. If it is necessary to lie to participants in the informed consent about the study they will perform (for example, the participants believe they will interact with other participants, but these people are actually confederates and part of the study) this should be explained after data collection has been completed in a debriefing. Researchers should also maintain the confidentiality of participants. Take special care when collecting open questions when you plan to share the data in a public repository."

    "section": "\n15.6 Test Yourself",
    "text": "15.6 Test Yourself\nQ1: Try to define ‘data fabrication’ in a single sentence. Start the sentence with ‘Data fabrication is any process through which’. Your definition should cover all forms of data fabrication that are dishonest, but it should not cover honest processes, such as simulating datasets.\nQ2: Imagine you are analyzing your data, and one participant has entered an age of 117 in a text-entry question in an experiment they performed behind a computer. Although it is not impossible to have this age, it is perhaps more likely that the participant intended to enter the value 17. Should you change the value to 17? Now imagine you have measured the amount of time (in seconds) people browse a website using the system clock on your computer, which is extremely accurate, and time measurement is perfectly reliable. There is an experimental condition, and a control condition. There is no statistically significant difference between the two groups. However, if you change the data of one participant in the control condition from 117 seconds to 17 seconds, the difference between groups is statistically significant, and confirms the prediction you made when designing the study.\nWhat is the difference between these two situations? Why is the second recoding of 117 to 7 a violation of the code of conduct for research integrity, according to the quote from the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity three paragraphs above this question? If you write up the average age of participants after having changed the age of this one participant from 117 to 17, what do you need to provide in addition to the statement ‘the mean age of participants was 20.4’ when this number is based on data you changed?\nQ3: The practice of sometimes reporting results, but other times not reporting results is referred to as selective reporting. When it comes to selective reporting, it is again the intention of the researcher that matters. It might make sense to not report a study that was flawed (e.g., there was a programming mistake in the experiment, or all participants misunderstood the instructions and provided useless input). It might also make sense to not extensively report a study that was badly designed – for example, you thought a manipulation would have a specific effect, but the manipulation does not work as intended. However, even such data might be useful to others, and the knowledge that the manipulation you thought would have a specific effect has no effect might prevent others in the future of making the same mistake. It would at least sometimes be beneficial for science if such results were shared in some way. But, as we will see below, researchers also choose to selectively report studies based on whether the results were statistically significant or not.\nA scientist performs several experiments, but only shares the results of those experiments that, after looking at the results, yield an outcome that supported their predictions. This scientist never shares the results of experiments that fail to support their predictions. How morally acceptable or unacceptable do you think the actions of this scientist are?\nQ4: A scientist performs several experiments, but only shares the results of those experiments that, after looking at the results, are judged to have been well-designed. This scientist never shares the results of experiments that, after looking at the data, are judged to be badly designed. How morally acceptable or unacceptable do you think the actions of this scientist are?\nQ5: A scientist performs one experiment in which several dependent variables are analyzed in multiple ways, but only shares the results of those analyses that, after looking at the results, yield an outcome that supported their predictions. This scientist never shares the results of analyses that fail to support their predictions. How morally acceptable or unacceptable do you think the actions of this scientist are?\nCurrent practice is that researchers do selectively report studies. When Franco et al. (2014) examined what happened to 106 studies part of a large collaborative national representative survey, they found that if the results yielded non-significant effects, 31 studies were not written up, 7 were written up but not published yet, and 10 were published. When results showed strong (statistically significant) effects, only 4 had not been written up, 31 were written up but not yet published, and 56 were published. There is clear evidence researchers selectively report results that confirmed their hypotheses, as we discussed in the chapter on bias.\nA recent study by Pickett and Roche (2017) examined the public perception of data fabrication, and selective reporting. Their results are summarized in the table below. As you can see, selective reporting is judged to be morally unacceptable by a large proportion of the public (71% believe it is morally unacceptable), and the majority of the public thinks there should be consequences when it is done (e.g., 73% believe such researchers should receive a funding ban). How do these percentages in the study by Pickett and Roche reflect your own judgments about how morally acceptable or unacceptable selective reporting is?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.2: Table from Pickett and Roche (2017) showing judgments of how moral selective reporting1 and data fraud are in the eyes of members of the general public.\n\n\n\n\nQ6: Assuming the results observed by Pickett and Roche, as well as the results by studies on questionable research practices summarized in Figure 15.1 are accurate and representative, there seems to be a large divide between current research practices, and what the general public think is morally acceptable. Do you think this divide is problematic? Do you think that if the general public was perfectly aware of current practices related to selective reporting, they would have a reason to evaluate the ways scientists work negatively, or do you think that with a good explanation of current practices, the general public would evaluate current practices positively?\nQ7: Given that researchers admit to using questionable research practices, they must have some benefits. What are benefits of using questionable research practices?\nQ8: What are downsides of using questionable research practices?\nTo improve research practices, we have seen many scientific fields move towards greater transparency. This includes sharing data and materials, clearer reporting of choices that were made during the data analysis, and pre-registering planned studies. It is almost impossible to prevent all fraud, but making research more transparent will make it easier to detect questionable research practices, such as selective reporting. At the same time, universities need to train people in research ethics, and make sure there is a climate where researchers (including you!) feel comfortable to do the right thing."

You will be able to check suggested answers below (which are an indication of what would be a good answer, although not exhaustive – your answer might highlight correct important points not mentioned in the answers below). Read through the answers below and determine a grade for your own answers. Use a grading from 1 (very bad answer) to 10 (excellent answer). Be truthful and just.\nAnswer Q1: Data fabrication is any process through which data are generated that can pass for real data, but that are not based on real underlying observations that were actually made by a researcher. The data are nevertheless presented as if they are based real observations.\nScore yourself between 1 (no answer) to 10 (perfect answer) points. Your grade should be higher, the better you indicated fabricated data look similar to real observations, and that they are intentionally presented as if they are real.\nAnswer Q2: The difference between the two cases is that in the second case, a researcher has the intention to generate an outcome that is in line with the outcome they want to observe. In terms of the quote by the Netherlands Code of Conduct of Research Integrity, what is missing is “explicit and proper justification”. What you need to provide if you report an average based on a 17 instead of a 117 is a footnote or statement indicating what you did (‘We changed one age value of 117 to 17’) and the justification for this (‘because we strongly suspected the value was a type on the participant was actually 17 years old’).\nScore yourself between 1 (no answer) to 10 (perfect answer) points. Your grade should be higher, the more aspects of the answer you provided (explaining the difference between the two cases based on the absence of a proper justification, specifying which aspect of the Netherlands Code of Conduct of Research Integrity is missing in the second case, and that you need to describe what you have changed, and the justification for changing it.\nQ3, Q4, Q5, and Q6 are your personal opinion, and are not graded.\nAnswer Q7: 1) because they are biased towards presenting support for their hypothesis to the world, 2) because they are much more strongly rewarded in their career for publishing results that ‘work’ than null results, and thus spend their time on the former, and 3) even if researchers would try to publish the results, journals are less likely to accept them for publication, 4) It is easier to publish a paper with a coherent story (only significant results). In general, we can expect the benefits of questionable research practices to be for individual scientists in the short run.\nScore yourself between 1 (no answer) to 10 (perfect answer) points. Your grade should be higher, the more of reasons you provided, including, but not limited to, the three above.\nAnswer Q8: For an individual scientist, the risk is colleagues find out, and lose prestige (or in extreme cases, their job). Failures to replicate their work might also impact their prestige. For society, a downside is that scientific research is not as reliable as it should be. For science, a downside could be that the reputation of science, and the trust people place in science, is damaged. In general, we can expect the costs for questionable research practices are for society in the long run.\nScore yourself between 1 (no answer) to 10 (perfect answer) points. Your grade should be higher, the more of reasons you provided, including, but not limited to, the three above.\nIf after all this work on research integrity you feel like you need something to cheer you up, this video might help.\n\n\n\n\nAgnoli, F., Wicherts, J.
